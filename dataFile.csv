0	Depeche Mode	"Let me take you on a trip
Around the world and back
And you won't have to move
You just sit still
Now let your mind do the walking
And let my body do the talking
Let me show you the world in my eyes

I'll take you to the highest mountain
To the depths of the deepest sea
And we won't need a map
Believe me
Now let my body do the moving
And let my hands do the soothing
Let me show you the world in my eyes


That's all there is
Nothing more than you can feel now
That's all there is


Let me put you on a ship
On a long, long trip
Your lips close to my lips
All the islands in the ocean
All the heaven's in motion
Let me show you the world in my eyes

That's all there is
Nothing more than you can touch now
That's all there is


Let me show you the world in my eyes
Let me show you the world in my eyes
Let me show you the world in my eyes
Let me show you the world in my eyes
Let me show you the world in my eyes
Let me show you the world in my eyes
Let me show you the world in my eyes"
1	Depeche Mode	"Reach out, touch faith

Your own personal Jesus
Someone to hear your prayers
Someone who cares
Your own personal Jesus
Someone to hear your prayers
Someone who's there
Feeling unknown
And you're all alone
Flesh and bone
By the telephone
Lift up the receiver
I'll make you a believer
Take second best
Put me to the test
Things on your chest
You need to confess
I will deliver
You know I'm a forgiver
Reach out, touch faith
Reach out, touch faith

Your own personal Jesus
Someone to hear your prayers
Someone who cares
Your own personal Jesus
Someone to hear your prayers
Someone who's there
Feeling unknown
And you're all alone
Flesh and bone
By the telephone
Lift up the receiver
I'll make you a believer
I will deliver
You know I'm a forgiver
Reach out, touch faith
Your own personal Jesus
Reach out, touch faith"
2	New Order	"Won't you please let me go
These words lie inside they hurt me so
And I'm not the kind that likes to tell you
Just what I want to do
I'm not the kind that needs to tell you
Just what you want me to
I saw you this morning
I thought that you might like to know
I received your message in full a few days ago
I understood every word that is said
And now that I've actually heard it
You're going to regret
And I'm not the kind that likes to tell you
Just what you want me to
You're not the kind that needs to tell me
About the birds and the bees
Do you find this happens all the time
Crucial point one day becomes a crime
And I'm not the kind that likes to tell you
Just what I want to do
I'm not the kind that needs to tell you

I've lost you
I've lost you
I've lost you
I've lost you
I've lost you
I've lost you
I've lost you
I've lost you
I've lost you
I've lost you
I've lost you
I've lost you
I've lost you
I've lost you
I've lost you"
3	Billy Idol	"On the floor of Tokyo
Or down in London town to go, go
With the record selection
And the mirror's reflection
I'm dancing with myself
When there's no-one else in sight
In the crowded lonely night
Well I wait so long
For my love vibration
And I'm dancing with myself

Oh oh dancing with myself
Oh oh dancing with myself
Well there's nothing to lose
And there's nothing to prove
I'll be dancing with myself
Oh uh oh oh

If I looked all over the world
And there's every type of girl
But your empty eyes
Seem to pass me by
Leave me dancing with myself

So let's sink another drink
Cause it'll give me time to think
If I had the chance
I'd ask the world to dance
And I'll be dancing with myself

Oh oh dancing with myself
Oh oh dancing with myself
Well there's nothing to lose
And there's nothing to prove
I'll be dancing with myself
Oh uh oh oh

If I looked all over the world
And there's every type of girl
But your empty eyes
Seem to pass me by
Leave me dancing with myself

So let's sink another drink
Cause it'll give me time to think
If I had the chance
I'd ask the world to dance
And I'll be dancing with myself

Oh dancing with myself
Oh dancing with myself
If I had the chance
I'd ask the world to dance
If I had the chance
I'd ask the world to dance
If I had the chance
I'd ask the world to dance
Dancing with myself
Dancing with myself
Dancing with myself
Dancing with myself

If I looked all over the world
And there's every type of girl
But your empty eyes
Seem to pass me by
Leave me dancing with myself

So let's sink another drink
Cause it'll give me time to think
If I had the chance
I'd ask the world to dance
And I'll be dancing with myself

Oh dancing with myself
Oh dancing with myself
If I had the chance
I'd ask the world to dance
If I had the chance
I'd ask the world to dance
If I had the chance
I'd ask the world to dance"
4	Tame Impala	"Someone said they left together
I ran out the door to get her
She was holding hands with Trevor
Not the greatest feeling ever
Said, ""Pull yourself together
You should try your luck with Heather""
Then I heard they slept together
Oh, the less I know the better
The less I know the better

Oh my love, can't you see yourself by my side
No surprise when you're on his shoulder like every night
Oh my love, can't you see that you're on my mind
Don't suppose we could convince your lover to change his mind
So goodbye

She said, ""It's not now or never
Wait ten years, we'll be together""
I said, ""Better late than never
Just don't make me wait forever""
Don't make me wait forever
Don't make me wait forever

Oh my love, can't you see yourself by my side?
I don't suppose you could convince your lover to change his mind

I was doing fine without ya
'Til I saw your face, now I can't erase
Giving in to all his bullshit
Is this what you want, is this who you are?
I was doing fine without ya
'Til I saw your eyes turn away from mine
Oh, sweet darling, where he wants you
Said, ""Come on Superman, say your stupid line""
Said, ""Come on Superman, say your stupid line""
Said, ""Come on Superman, say your stupid line"""
5	Daft Punk	"I didn't want to be the one to forget
I thought of everything I'd never regret
A little time with you is all that I get
That's all we need because it's all we can take
One thing I never see the same when you're 'round
I don’t believe in him — his lips on the ground
I wanna take you to that place in the “Roche”
But no one gives us any time anymore
He ask me once if I’d look in on his dog
You made an offer for it, then you ran off
I got this picture of us kids in my head
And all I hear is the last thing that you said

""I listened to your problems
Now listen to mine""
I didn't want to anymore, oh

And we will never be alone again
Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
Cause I know it unlocks like a door
And we will never be alone again
Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Gotta give it up or give it away
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
Some more again

It didn't matter what they wanted to see
He thought he saw someone that looked just like me
The summer memory that just never dies
We worked too long and hard to give it no time
He sees right through me, it's so easy with lies
Cracks in the road that I would try and disguise
He runs his scissor at the seam in the wall
He cannot break it down or else he would fall
1,000 lonely stars hiding in the cold
Take it, oh I don't wanna sing anymore

""I listened to your problems
Now listen to mine""
I didn't want to anymore, oh

And we will never be alone again
Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
Cause I don't know what else I can do
And we will never be alone again
Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
Cause I don't know what else I–

I don't understand, don't get upset
I'm not with you
We’re swimming around, it's all I do
When I'm with you

And we will never be alone again
Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
Cause I don't know what else I can do
And we will never be alone again
Cause it doesn't happen every day
Kinda counted on you being a friend
Can I give it up or give it away?
Now I thought about what I wanna say
But I never really know where to go
So I chained myself to a friend
Cause I don't know what else I can do"

7	Queen	"One two three four

While the sun hangs in the sky and the desert has sand
While the waves crash in the sea and meet the land
While there's a wind and the stars and the rainbow
Till the mountains crumble into the plain

Oh yes we'll keep on trying
Tread that fine line
Oh we'll keep on trying yeah
Just passing our time

While we live according to race, color or creed
While we rule by blind madness and pure greed
Our lives dictated by tradition, superstition, false religion
Through the eons, and on and on

Oh yes we'll keep on trying
We'll tread that fine line
Oh we'll keep on trying
Till the end of time
Till the end of time

Through the sorrow all through our splendor
Don't take offence at my innuendo


You can be anything you want to be
Just turn yourself into anything you think that you could ever be
Be free with your tempo, be free be free
Surrender your ego - be free, be free to yourself


If there's a God or any kind of justice under the sky
If there's a point, if there's a reason to live or die
If there's an answer to the questions we feel bound to ask
Show yourself - destroy our fears - release your mask

Oh yes we'll keep on trying
Hey! Tread that fine line
Yeah, we'll keep on smiling, yeah
And whatever will be, will be

We'll just keep on trying
We'll just keep on trying
Till the end of time
Till the end of time
Till the end of time"
8	Elton John	"She packed my bags last night, pre-flight
Zero hour: 9:00 a.m
And I'm gonna be high as a kite by then
I miss the Earth so much, I miss my wife
It's lonely out in space
On such a timeless flight

And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no! I'm a rocket man
Rocket man! Burning out his fuse up here alone
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no! I'm a rocket man
Rocket man! Burning out his fuse up here alone

Mars ain't the kind of place to raise your kids
In fact, it's cold as hell
And there's no one there to raise them if you did
And all this science I don't understand
It's just my job five days a week
A rocket man! A rocket man!

And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no! I'm a rocket man
Rocket man! Burning out his fuse up here alone
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
'Til touchdown brings me 'round again to find
I'm not the man they think I am at home
Oh no, no, no! I'm a rocket man
Rocket man! Burning out his fuse up here alone

And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time
And I think it's gonna be a long, long time"
9	Guns N' Roses	"I'm a cold heartbreaker, fit to burn
And I'll rip your heart in two
And I'll leave you lying on the bed
I'll be out the door before you wake
It's nothing new to you
'Cause I think we've seen that movie, too

'Cause you could be mine
But you're way out of line
With your bitch slap rapping and your cocaine tongue
You get nothing done
I said, you could be mine

Now, holidays come, and then they go
It's nothing new, today
Collect another memory
When I come home, late at night
Don't ask me where I've been
Just count your stars I'm home again

'Cause you could be mine
But you're way out of line
With your bitch slap rapping and your cocaine tongue
You get nothing done
I said, you could be mine
You could be mine
You could be mine
You could be mine
You could be mine
You could be mine, mine, mine ,mine

You've gone sketching too many times
Why don't you give it a rest?
Why must you find another reason to cry?


Well, you're breaking down my back and I've been racking out my brain
It don't matter how we make it, 'cause it always ends the same
You can push it for more mileage, but your flaps are wearing thin
And I could sleep on it until morning, but this nightmare never ends
Don't forget to call my lawyers with ridiculous demands
An' you can take the pity so far, but it's more than I can stand
Cause this couch-trip's getting older
Tell me how long has it been?
'Cause 5 years is forever, and you haven't grown up yet

You could be mine
But you're way out of line
With your bitch slap rappin' and your cocaine tongue
You get nothing done
I said, you could be mine
You should be
You could be mine
You could be mine
You could be mine
You could be mine
You could be mine
You could be mine
You could be mine
Yeah"
10	The Notorious B.I.G.	"('Fuck all you hoes!' Get a grip, motherfucker!)
Yeah, this album is dedicated
To all the teachers that told me I'd never amount to nothin'
To all the people that lived above the buildings that I was hustlin' in front of
Called the police on me when I was just tryin' to make some money to feed my daughter (it's all good)
And all the niggas in the struggle
You know what I'm sayin'? It's all good, baby baby

It was all a dream, I used to read Word Up! magazine
Salt-n-Pepa and Heavy D up in the limousine
Hangin' pictures on my wall
Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl
I let my tape rock 'til my tape popped
Smokin' weed in Bambu, sippin' on Private Stock
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match
Remember Rappin' Duke? Duh-ha, duh-ha
You never thought that hip-hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
Peace to Ron G, Brucie B, Kid Capri
Funkmaster Flex, Lovebug Starski
I'm blowin' up like you thought I would
Call the crib, same number, same hood, it's all good
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga

You know very well
Who you are
Don't let 'em hold you down
Reach for the stars
You had a goal
But not that many
'Cause you're the only one
I'll give you good and plenty

I made the change from a common thief
To up close and personal with Robin Leach and I'm far from cheap
I smoke skunk with my peeps all day
Spread love, it's the Brooklyn way
The Moët and Alizé keep me pissy, girls used to diss me
Now they write letters 'cause they miss me
I never thought it could happen, this rapping stuff
I was too used to packing gats and stuff
Now honeys play me close like butter play toast
From the Mississippi down to the East Coast
Condos in Queens, indo for weeks
Sold out seats to hear Biggie Smalls speak
Living life without fear
Puttin' five karats in my baby girl ear
Lunches, brunches, interviews by the pool
Considered a fool 'cause I dropped out of high school
Stereotypes of a black male misunderstood
And it's still all good
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga

You know very well
Who you are
Don't let 'em hold you down
Reach for the stars
You had a goal
But not that many
'Cause you're the only one
I'll give you good and plenty

Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis
When I was dead broke, man, I couldn't picture this
50-inch screen, money-green leather sofa
Got two rides, a limousine with a chauffeur
Phone bill about two G's flat
No need to worry, my accountant handles that
And my whole crew is loungin'
Celebrating every day, no more public housin'
Thinkin' back on my one-room shack
Now my mom pimps an Ac' with minks on her back
And she loves to show me off of course
Smiles every time my face is up in The Source
We used to fuss when the landlord dissed us
No heat, wonder why Christmas missed us
Birthdays was the worst days
Now we sip Champagne when we thirsty
Uh, damn right I like the life I live
'Cause I went from negative to positive
And it's all… (It's all good, nigga)
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga

You know very well
Who you are
Don't let 'em hold you down
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga
Reach for the stars
You had a goal
But not that many
'Cause you're the only one
I'll give you good and plenty
And if you don't know, now you know, nigga

Representin' B-Town in the house
Junior Mafia, mad flavor
Uh, uh, yeah, a'ight

You know very well
Who you are
Don't let 'em hold you down
Reach for the stars
You had a goal
But not that many
'Cause you're the only one
I'll give you good and plenty

Biggie Smalls, it's all good, nigga
Junior Mafia, it's all good, nigga
Bad Boy, it's all good, nigga
It's all good
That's right, '94
And on and on, and on and on
You know very well
It's all good
Who you are
Yeah…
Don't let 'em hold you down
Reach for the stars"
11	2Pac	"Shit, tired of gettin' shot at
Tired of gettin' chased by the police and arrested
Niggas need a spot where we can kick it
A spot where we belong, that's just for us
Niggas ain't gotta get all dressed up and be Hollywood
Y'knahmean? Where do niggas go when we die?
Ain't no heaven for a thug nigga
That's why we go to thug mansion
That's the only place where thugs get in free
And you gotta be a G, at thug mansion

A place to spend my quiet nights, time to unwind
So much pressure in this life of mine, I cry at times
I once contemplated suicide, and woulda tried
But when I held that 9, all I could see was my mama's eyes
No one knows my struggle, they only see the trouble
Not knowin' it's hard to carry on when no one loves you
Picture me inside the misery of poverty
No man alive has ever witnessed struggles I survived
Prayin' hard for better days, promise to hold on
Me and my dawgs ain't have a choice but to roll on
We found a finally spot to kick it
Where we can drink liquor and no one bickers over trick shit
A spot where we can smoke in peace, and even though we G's
We still visualize places that we can roll in peace
And in my mind's eye, I see this place the players go and pass it
I got a spot for us all, so we can ball, at thug's mansion

Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chillin' with homies and family
Sky high, iced out, paradise in the sky
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed-out, mansion in paradise, in the sky

Will I survive all the fights and the darkness?
Trouble sparks, they tell me: ""Home is where the heart is.""
Dear departed, I shed tattooed tears
And couldn't sleep good for multiple years
Witness peers catch gunshots; nobody cares
Seen the politicians ban us, they'd rather see us locked in chains
Please explain why they can't stand us
Is there a way for me to change?
Or am I just a victim of things I did to maintain?
I need a place to rest my head
With the little bit of homeboys that remains
‘Cause all the rest dead; is there a spot for us to roll?
If you find it, I'll be right behind ya, show me and I'll go
How can I be peaceful? I'm comin' from the bottom
Watch my daddy scream ""Peace!"" while the other man shot him
I need a house that's full of love, when I need to escape
The deadly places slingin' drugs, in thug's mansion

Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chillin' with homies and family
Sky high, iced out, paradise in the sky
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed-out, mansion in paradise, in the sky

Dear Mama, don't cry, your baby boy's doin' good
Tell the homies I'm in Heaven and they ain't got hoods
Seen a show with Marvin Gaye last night, it had me shook
Drinkin' peppermint Schnapps, with Jackie Wilson and Sam Cooke
Then some lady named Billie Holiday sang
Sittin' there kickin' it with Malcolm 'til the day came
Little Latasha sho' grown
Tell the lady in the liquor store that she's forgiven, so come home
Maybe in time you'll understand
Only God can save us, when Miles Davis cuttin' lose with the band
Just think of all the people that you knew in the past
That passed on, they in Heaven, found peace at last
Picture a place that they exist, together
There has to be a place better than this, in Heaven
So right before I sleep, dear God, what I'm askin'
Remember this face, save me a place in thug's mansion

Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chillin' with homies and family
Sky high, iced out, paradise in the sky (in thugs mansion)
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed-out, mansion in paradise, in the sky (thugs mansion)
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Chillin' with homies and family
Sky high, iced out, paradise, in the sky (in thugs mansion)
Ain't no place I'd rather be
Only place that's right for me
Chromed-out, mansion in paradise, in the sky"
12	Duran Duran	"Mine, immaculate dream made breath and skin
I've been waiting for you
Signed, with a home tattoo
Happy birthday to you was created for you
(Can't ever keep from falling apart at the seams)
(Can not believe you've taken my heart to pieces)
Oh, it'll take a little time
Might take a little crime
To come undone now

We'll try to stay blind
To the hope and fear outside
Hey child, stay wilder than the wind
And blow me into cry

Who do you need, who do you love
When you come undone?
Who do you need, who do you love
When you come undone?

Words, playing me deja vu
Like a radio tune i swear i've heard before
Chills, is it something real
Or the magic I'm feeding off your fingers?
(Can not forgive from falling apart at the seams)
(Can not believe you're taking my heart to pieces)
Lost, in a snow filled sky
We'll make it alright
To come undone now

We'll try to stay blind
To the hope and fear outside
Hey child, stay wilder than the wind
And blow me into cry

Who do you need, who do you love
When you come undone?
Who do you need, who do you love
When you come undone?

(Can not forgive from falling apart)
Who do you need, who do you love
When you come undone?
(Can not forgive from falling apart)
Who do you need, who do you love?
(Can not forgive from falling apart)
Who do you love
When you come undone?
(Can not forgive from falling apart)"
13	Duran Duran	"Came in from a rainy Thursday
On the avenue
Thought I heard you talking softly
I turned on the lights, the TV
And the radio
Still I can't escape the ghost of you
What has happened to it all?
Crazy, some'd say
Where is the life that I recognize?
Gone away
But I won't cry for yesterday
There's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way
To the ordinary world
I will learn to survive
Passion or coincidence
Once prompted you to say
""Pride will tear us both apart""
Well now pride's gone out the window
Cross the rooftops
Run away
Left me in the vacuum of my heart
What is happening to me?
Crazy, some'd say
Where is my friend when I need you most?
Gone away
But I won't cry for yesterday
There's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way
To the ordinary world
I will learn to survive
Papers in the roadside
Tell of suffering and greed
Here today, forgot tomorrow
Ooh, here besides the news
Of holy war and holy need
Ours is just a little sorrowed talk
And I don't cry for yesterday
There's an ordinary world
Somehow I have to find
And as I try to make my way
To the ordinary world
I will learn to survive
Every one
Is my world, I will learn to survive
Any one
Is my world, I will learn to survive
Any one
Is my world
Every one
Is my world"

No le temo a la muerte
Todos vamos para el juicio

Ahora que estoy afuera

Crack Family in the streets
Colombian crack music (bis)

Voy directo pa la gente de mis calles
Escuchen bien
No juzgue lo que usted no sabe
Un pensamiento en esto
Nunca te distrabe
Escuche mucho mas de lo que hable

Los efectos mariposas
En cada papel
Y si mañana te va bien
Espero que hoy también
Recuerdas la mujer
Que nunca te fue tan fiel
Se fue como la rima que arrugo ese papel

Analizando la ciudad
Desde otro punto de vista
Haciendo un leve resumen
De lo que ha sido mi vida
Auto analizarme en este día soleado
Y recordarme como pierdo horas
En maricadas que no debía
Darme cuenta que mi tiempo vale
Y cada segundo que pasa
Soy mas fuerte o el débil vencido
Del indomable que arde

Le pido a cristo
Que recuerde cada hora
Antes de rapear bonito
Hay que aprender a ser persona
Contagiese de vida
Y no llene su pipa de bazuca
Esa basura te mortifica
Mas bien ve a casa
Y recoge a tu madre
Que esta noche llega tarde
Y este barrio esta que arde
Por ese niño triste y vacío
Que su inocencia se fue atravesada
En el primer cuchillo

Gaminart por el paraíso
No le temo a la muerte
Todos vamos para el juicio

Es como esa ley de atracción inversa
Entre menos sueñes con la fama
Mas llegas a ella
Filosofía de vida
Que se vende por monedas
Yo tan solo me siento
A la orilla del planeta
Apuntarle a ese pulpo blanco
Que somos mas los raperos que la suma
De sus tentáculos
Obstáculo tras obstáculo
Aerophonico
Crack melódico

It's up
I've been around places
Where all love is farce
I've been around niggas
That it whole left is gone
I thought you saw
And I bet I seen it all
I've achieved this life now nigga
Cuz I've been through war

Hoy sigo siendo el mismo
Labrando lo indecible
Sin miedo a que la sombra
De lo imposible cubra por
Completo lo que hasta hoy
He conseguido con esfuerzo
Lágrimas y promesas al viento
Camino seguro y tranquilo
Decidido a darle respuestas
A mis preguntas sin sentido
Y por mi parte estar convencido
Que no cambio así tuviera dinero
En mis bolsillos

Auto criticarme ?
Lampara arrogante
Burlón, vanidoso a traición
Trabajador de mente mi profesión
Faltón nunca he sido
No se ni lo que quiero
Pero si lo pierdo
Mi alma lo lamentaria
En este día miro al cielo
Lagrimean, mis ojos son ríos
El azul transparente y la brisa
De mi fantasía me hacen un niño
Inocente
No pienso en la gente
Ya se cual es mi camino
Por la cuerda floja
Equilibrando mi destino
Escrito estoy en el libro
De la fantasía
Aerophonicos
Crack melodicos

Gaminart por el paraíso
No le temo a la muerte
Todos vamos para el juicio
Y salir de la calle luchaba
Ahora que estoy afuera
Jalare a los que quieran salir
Crack Family in the streets

16	Nas	"Life, I wonder
Will it take me under?
I don't know

Imagine smoking weed in the streets without cops harassin'
Imagine going to court with no trial
Lifestyle cruising blue Bahama waters, no welfare supporters
More conscious of the way we raise our daughters
Days are shorter, nights are colder
Feeling like life is over, these snakes strike like a cobra
The world's hot my son got knocked, evidently
It's elementary, they want us all gone eventually
Trooping out of state for a plate of knowledge
If coke was cooked without the garbage
We'd all have the top dollars
Imagine everybody flashin', fashion, designer clothes
Lacing your clique up with diamond Roles
Your people holding dough, no parole, no rubbers
Go in raw, imagine law with no undercovers
Just some thoughts for the mind
I take a glimpse into time
Watch the blimp read ""The World Is Mine""

If I ruled the world (imagine that)
I'd free all my sons, I love 'em love 'em, baby
Black diamonds and pearls
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world
(Still living for today, in these last days and times)

The way to be, paradise like relaxin'
Black, Latino and Anglo-Saxon
Armani Exchange deranged
Cash, Lost Tribe of Shabazz, free at last
Brand new whips to crash, then we laugh in the iller path
The Villa house is for the crew, how we do
Trees for breakfast, dime sexes and Benz stretches
So many years of depression make me vision
The better livin', type of place to raise kids in
Open they eyes to the lies history's told foul
But I'm as wise as the old owl, plus the Gold Child
Seeing things like I was controllin', click rollin'
Tricking six digits on kicks and still holdin'
Trips to Paris, I civilized every savage
Give me one shot, I turn trife life to lavish
Political prisoner set free, stress free
No work release, purple M3's and jet skis
Feel the wind breeze in West Indies
I make Coretta Scott-King mayor the cities
And reverse fiends to Willies
It sounds foul, but every girl I meet'd go downtown
I'd open every cell in Attica, send 'em to Africa

If I ruled the world (imagine that)
I'd free all my sons, I love 'em love 'em, baby
Black diamonds and pearls
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world
(Still living for today, in these last days and times)

And then we'll walk right up to the sun
Hand in hand
We'll walk right up to the sun
We won't land

You'd love to hear the story how the thugs live in worry
Duck down in car seats, heat's mandatory
Running from Jake, getting chased, hunger for papes
These are the breaks, many mistakes go down out of state
Wait, I had to let it marinate, we carry weight
Trying to get laced, flip the ace, stack the safe
Millionaire plan to keep the gat with the cocked hammer
Making moves in Atlanta, back-and-forth scrambler
‘Cause you could have all the chips, be poor or rich
Still nobody want a nigga having shit
If I ruled the world and everything in it, sky's the limit
I push a Q-45 Infinit(i)
It wouldn't be no such thing as jealousies or B Felonies
Strictly living longevity to the destiny
I thought I'd never see, but reality struck
Better find out before your time's out, what the fuck?

If I ruled the world (imagine that)
I'd free all my sons, I love 'em love 'em, baby
Black diamonds and pearls
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine?)
If I ruled the world
(Still living for today, in these last days and times)
If I ruled the world, if I ruled, if I ruled (imagine that)
I'd free all my sons, if I ruled, if I ruled
I love 'em love 'em baby
Black diamonds and pearls, black diamonds, black diamonds
(Could it be, if you could be mine, we'd both shine)
If I ruled the world
(Still living for today, in these last days and times)

If I ruled the world, if I ruled
If I ruled, I'd free all my sons
Black diamonds, I love 'em love 'em baby
Black diamonds and pearls, if I ruled
If I ruled the world
If I ruled the world
I love 'em love 'em baby!!"

A miracle, oh it was beautiful, magical
And all the birds in the trees, well they'd be singing so happily
Joyfully, playfully watching me
But then they send me away to teach me how to be sensible
Logical, responsible, practical
And they showed me a world where I could be so dependable
Clinical, intellectual, cynical

There are times when all the world's asleep
The questions run too deep
For such a simple man
Won't you please, please tell me what we've learned
I know it sounds absurd
But please tell me who I am

Now watch what you say or they'll be calling you a radical
Liberal, fanatical, criminal
Won't you sign up your name, we'd like to feel you're
Acceptable, respectable, presentable, a vegetable
Oh, take, take, take it yeah


At night, when all the world's asleep
The questions run so deep
For such a simple man
Won't you please, please tell me what we've learned
I know it sounds absurd
But please tell me who I am, who I am, who I am, who I am

Into your satellite, shining a battle light

One-time tried to come in my home
Take my chrome, I said, ""Yo it's on!
Take cover son, or you're assed out!
How do you like my chrome?"" Then I watched the rookie pass out
Didn't have to blast him but, I did any way
Ha ha ha ha ha! Young punk had to pay
So I just killed the man!

Would call the one time and play the role model?
No! I think you'll play like a thug
Next hear the shot of a magnum slug
Humming, coming at ya!
Yeah, you know I'm gonna to gat ya!
How do you know where I'm at
When you haven't been where I've been?
Understand where I'm coming from!
While you're up on the hill in your big home
I'm out here risking my dome, just for a bucket, or a fast ducat
Just to stay alive, yo, I gotta say, ""Fuck it!""

No sé bien qué día es hoy
Solo sé que te vi salir
Y en cinco minutos perdí
Las letras para hablarte a vos

Yo sé, yo sé que no tengo palabras
Y nunca las voy a tener
Por eso aprovecho esta noche
Ya ves, estoy sola otra vez

Por eso aprovecho esta noche
Tal vez lo puedas entender (lo entiendo)
No me importa poner las letras
Solo me importa mi mujer

Mañana cuando te levantes
Y pienses lo que dije ayer
¡Ay viejo!, en este juego
A mi siempre me toca perder
[Coro: Both, Vicentico)
Siempre habrá vasos vacíos, oh
Con agua de la ciudad
La nuestra es agua de río
Mezclada con mar, oh yeah
Levanta los brazos mujer
Y ponte esta noche a bailar
Que la nuestra es agua de río
Mezclada con mar

¡Te están buscando, Matador!

Me dicen el Matador, nací en Barracas
Si hablamos de matar, mis palabras matan
No hace mucho tiempo que cayó el León Santillán
Y ahora sé que en cualquier momento me la van a dar
(Ma-matador, Ma-matador)
¿Dónde estás Matador?
(Ma-matador, Ma-matador)

Me dicen el Matador, me están buscando
En una fría pensión los estoy esperando
Agazapado en lo más oscuro de mi habitación
Fusil en mano, espero mi final

(Ma-matador, Ma-matador)
La cana te busca, Matador
(Ma-matador, Ma-matador)
La cana te prende, Matador

No te vayas, Matador

¡Oh, yeah!

Viento de libertad, sangre combativa
En los bolsillos del pueblo, la vieja herida
De pronto el día se me hace de noche
Murmullos, corridas y el golpe en la puerta
¡Llegó la fuerza policial!

(Ma-matador, Ma-matador)
Mirá, hermano, en qué terminaste
(Ma-matador, Ma-matador)
Por pelear por un mundo mejor
¿Qué suenan? ¡Son balas! ¡Me alcanzan! ¡Me atrapan!
¡Resiste! ¡Víctor Jara, no calla!

Me dicen el Matador de los cien barrios porteños
No tengo por qué tener miedo, mis palabras son balas
Balas de paz, balas de justicia
Soy la voz de los que hicieron callar sin razón
Por el solo hecho de pensar distinto, ¡ay Dios!

Siguiendo la luna no llegaré lejos
Tan lejos como se pueda llegar
Las cosas que dije no tienen sentido
No puedo detenerme, ponerme a pensar, oh

Siguiendo la luna y su vuelta invisible
La noche seguro que me alcanzará
No es que tu mirada me sea imposible
Tan solo es la forma como caminas, oh oh

Vamos, mi cariño ,que todo está bien
Esta noche cambiaré, te juro que cambiaré
Vamos, mi cariño, ya no llores más
Por vos yo bajaría el sol, o me hundiría en el mar
Y esto parece verdad para mí, oh

Suena como un crimen lo que tú me has hecho
Deberías ir a parar a la prisión
Suena como un crimen que me hayas mentido
Que hayas engañado a este corazón, oh

Siguiendo la luna no llegaré lejos
Tan lejos como se pueda llegar
Son casi las cuatro de la madrugada
Mi casa brillaba, cruzando ese mar


Vamos, mi cariño, que todo está bien
Esta noche cambiaré, te juro que cambiaré
Vamos, mi cariño, ya no llores más
Por vos yo bajaría el sol, o me hundiría en el mar

Y esto parece verdad para mí
Y esto parece verdad para mí
Y esto parece... verdad para mí
Y esto parece verdad para mí
Y esto parece verdad para mí
Y esto parece verdad para mí, para mí
Y esto parece verdad para mí, uh

Hold me close and hold me fast
The magic spell you cast
This is La Vie En Rose
When you kiss me heaven sighs
And though I close my eyes
I see La Vie En Rose
When you press me to your heart
I'm in a world apart
A world where roses bloom
And when you speak...angels sing from above
Everyday words seem...to turn into love songs
Give your heart and soul to me
And life will always be
La Vie En Rose"

And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
Yes, heaven, I'm in heaven
And the cares that hung around me through the week
Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
Oh I'd love to climb a mountain
And reach the highest peak
But it doesn't thrill me half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek
Oh I'd love to go out fishing
In a river or a creek
But I don't enjoy it half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek
Now, mama, dance with me
I want my arms about you
The charms about you
Will carry me through, yes
Heaven, I'm in heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
(Sing it Ella, swing it)
Heaven, I'm in heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
Heaven, I'm in heaven
And the cares that hung around me through the week
Seem to vanish like a gambler's lucky streak
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
Oh I'd love to climb a mountain
And reach the highest peak
But it doesn't thrill me half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek
Oh I love to go out fishing
In a river or a creek
But I don't enjoy it half as much
As dancing cheek to cheek
Come on and dance with me
I want my arm about you
The charm about you
Will carry me through to
Heaven, I'm in heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek
When we're out together dancing cheek to cheek
Yes, dance with me
I want my arm(s) about you
The charm(s) about you
Will carry me through to
Heaven, I'm in heaven
And my heart beats so that I can hardly speak
And I seem to find the happiness I seek

I never thought I'd meet a girl like you
Meet a girl like you

With auburn hair and tawny eyes
The kind of eyes that hypnotize me through
Hypnotize me through

And I ran, I ran so far away
I just ran, I ran all night and day
Couldn't get away

A cloud appears above your head
A beam of light comes shining down on you
Shining down on you

The cloud is moving nearer still
Aurora borealis comes in view
Aurora comes in view


Reached out a hand to touch your face
You're slowly disappearing from my view
Disappearing from my view

Reached out a hand to try again
I'm floating in a beam of light with you

Armed and dangerous, ain't too many can bang with us
Straight up weed, no angel dust
Label us ""Notorious
Thug-ass niggas that love to bust,"" it's strange to us
Y'all niggas be scramblin', gamblin'
Up in restaurants with mandolins and violins
We just sittin' here tryna win, try not to sin
High off weed and lots of gin
So much smoke, need oxygen
Steadily countin' them Benjamins
Nigga, you should too if you knew what this game'll do to you
Been in this shit since '92
Look at all the bullshit I been through
So-called beef with you-know-who
Fucked a few female stars or two
Then I blew like, nigga, move like Mike
Shit, not to be fucked with
Motherfucker better duck quick
'Cause me and my dogs love to buck shit
Fuck the luck shit, strictly aim
No aspirations to quit the game
Spit your game, talk your shit
Grab your gat, call your clique
Squeeze your clip, hit the right one
Pass that weed, I got to light one
All them niggas, I got to fight one
All them hoes, I got to like one
Our situation is a tight one
What you gonna do: fight or run?
Seems to me that you'll take B
Bone and Big, nigga, die slowly
I'ma tell you like a nigga told me
""Cash Rules Everything Around Me""
Shit, lyrically, niggas can't see me
Fuck it, buy the coke, cook the coke, cut it
Know the bitch 'fore you caught yourself lovin' it
Nigga with a Benz fuckin' it
Doesn't it seem odd to you?
Big come through with mobs and crews
Goodfellas down to the Mo' Thugs dudes
Who's the killer: me or you?

We forgive you, for you know not what you do

7 AM, woke in the morning
With Hen' and caffeine and green and nicotine
No dough, so pop a couple of doze
Lil' RIPsta, nigga Mista Clean, nigga Dean
Deep in my temple and not to get sentimentally steamed
With my instrumelody, and heated, especially for your team
And a .45 indeed will beam in between the scenes
Destroy your dreams; you willin' to die? We'll see
How many flee when I cause the scene?
We mean mug, Mo' Thugs, trained to be perfect disciples
When it's survival, tongue is a double-edged sword
Triple six rivals spittin' fire
This the real truth, bitch, breakin' out for lies
My Messiah's better be ready for Armageddon, shit's expired
It's wild, bless the child, the one that became a man
Put in positions off in the Clair
All that I had to do was stare
Test me now, contender; never no surrender, no pretend
Pick up my pen, in my hand, one of my trusted friend-friends
Hey, open it! Let's see if we're real, we all suited
Beg my pardon to Martin: baby, we ain't marchin', we shootin'
In daily recruitin', there's a thug born everyday in the ghetto
We start 'em off little, we give 'em a bible
And a pen and a pad to hit the label – kick it, nigga!

Nigga roll with Bone up into the Thug spot
To the dome with a shot of bird
Never get tossed to the curb
Be feelin' that urge to splurge
But I'm broke as fuck, Sin, give me that Mossberg swerve!
Up into my bag, ‘cause I gotta get my mask and shells
To put in this 12 gauge sawed-off
Get 'em hauled off, nigga, your loss
Take it all off, got a nigga caught off
But the Bone, not Leatherface
Too many are thinkin' they thugs
And little Mo Hart want to pull it and bust it
And bitch, if you steppin', we buckin' them guts – that's fucked up
Now let me get done with the grime
Gotta go purchase a dime
Put in a state to get done with the crime
Smokin' the reefer to ease my mind
Swig some wine, step on the block with the rocks
But really we be servin' them dummies, see?
Gotta buck him on down
If he come back talkin', like, ""Give me back me money!""
Thuggin' with me killers
Need us a liter of liquor, but niggas ain't got shit
With a sawed-off pump, chrome .38 pistol
Now, who ready to get bent?
Nigga like me fiendin' for them green leaves
But I ain't had no dough
Gotta make some money
So I'm makin' my dummy rocks if I go broke

Yeah, Little Lay, hey, comin' in the form of scripture
Finna get ya and hit ya with magic
Droppin' down lead, but I call it my gadgets
With an automatic-status, we spray
Time to load the Glocks, but I'm thinkin' not
There's another evil force tellin' me to do what I gotta do
So I up my pipe, a nigga dyin' tonight
And I'm always runnin' from the boys in blue
Biggie, blue’s on my ass
Pull out the cellular phone to call Bone: ""What's happenin'?""
Grab artillery, a nigga start packin'
‘Cause a motherfucker tried to get me in a jackin'
And I did him, hit him right between the eyes
The spot was wise; wanna test a nigga size, it'll cost him
Nigga fuck around with the wrong shit
Y'all get mo' murdered all day, all day
We done paved the way and I'm on the run
I'ma call my boys and bring all the guns
Y'all niggas wanna have a little fun with number one, one, one?
Bloody red, red, rum, rum, rum, rum, rum, rum
Bloody red, red, rum, rum, rum, rum, rum, rum

37	The Cranberries	"Another head hangs lowly
Child is slowly taken
And the violence caused such silence
Who are we mistaken?

But you see, it's not me
It's not my family
In your head, in your head, they are fightin'
With their tanks, and their bombs
And air bombs, and their guns
In your head, in your head, they are cryin'

In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head?
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie, oh

Du, du, du, du
Du, du, du, du
Du, du, du, du
Du, du, du, du

Another mother's breakin'
Heart is takin' over
When the violence causes silence
We must be mistaken

It's the same old theme
Since nineteen-sixteen
In your head, in your head, they're still fightin'
With their tanks, and their bombs
And air bombs, and their guns
In your head, in your head, they are dyin'

In your head, in your head
Zombie, zombie, zombie-ie-ie
What's in your head, in your head?

Don't turn away from me
Cause I've spent half my life out there
You wouldn't disagree

Do you see me, do you see?
Do you like me
Do you like me standing there?
Do you notice, do you know
Do you see me, do you see me?
Does anyone care?

Unhappiness where's when I was young
And we didn't give a damn
Cause we were raised
To see life as fun and take it if we can
My mother, my mother
She'd hold me
She'd hold me when I was out there
My father, my father
He liked me, well he liked me
Does anyone care?

Understand what I've become
It wasn't my design
And people everywhere think
Something better than I am

But I miss you, I miss
Cause I liked it
Cause I liked it
When I was out there
Do you know this, do you know
You did not find me
You did not find
Does anyone care?

Unhappiness where's when I was young
And we didn't give a damn
Cause we were raised
To see life as fun and take it if we can

He liked me, well he liked me

39	Evanescence	"Now I will tell you what I've done for you
50 thousand tears I've cried
Screaming, deceiving and bleeding for you
And you still won't hear me (going under)
Don't want your hand this time - I'll save myself
Maybe I'll wake up for once (wake up for once)
Not tormented, daily defeated by you
Just when I thought I'd reached the bottom
I'm dying again
I'm going under (going under)
Drowning in you (drowning in you)
I'm falling forever (falling forever)
I've got to break through
I'm going under
Blurring and stirring the truth and the lies
(So I don't know what's real)
So I don't know what's real and what's not (don't know what's real and what's not)
Always confusing the thoughts in my head
So I can't trust myself anymore
I'm dying again
I'm going under (going under)
Drowning in you (drowning in you)
I'm falling forever (falling forever)
I've got to break through
I'm...
So go on and scream
Scream at me, I'm so far away (so far away)
I won't be broken again (again)
I've got to breathe - I can't keep going under
I'm dying again
I'm going under (going under)
Drowning in you (drowning in you)
I'm falling forever (falling forever)
I've got to break through
I'm going under (going under)
I'm going under (drowning in you)
I'm going under"
40	Evanescence	"I'm so tired of being here
Suppressed by all my childish fears
And if you have to leave
I wish that you would just leave
Your presence still lingers here
And it won't leave me alone

These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
There's just too much that time cannot erase

When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have
All of me

You used to captivate me
By your resonating light
Now I'm bound by the life you left behind
Your face it haunts
My once pleasant dreams
Your voice it chased away
All the sanity in me

These wounds won't seem to heal
This pain is just too real
There's just too much that time cannot erase

When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have
All of me

I've tried so hard to tell myself that you're gone
But though you're still with me
I've been alone all along

When you cried I'd wipe away all of your tears
When you'd scream I'd fight away all of your fears
And I held your hand through all of these years
But you still have all
All of me, me, me"
41	Billy Idol	"Last night a little dancer came dancing to my door
Last night a little angel came pumping on my floor
She said, ""Come on baby, I got a licence for love
And if it expires pray help from above""

In the midnight hour she cried more, more, more
With a rebel yell she cried more, more, more
In the midnight hour babe more, more, more
With a rebel yell more, more, more
More, more, more

She don't like slavery, she won't sit and beg
But when I'm tired and lonely she sees me to bed
What set you free and brought you to be me babe
What set you free I need you here by me
Because

In the midnight hour she cried more, more, more
With a rebel yell she cried more, more, more
In the midnight hour babe more, more, more
With a rebel yell
More, more, more

He lives in his own heaven
Collects it to go from the 7-11
Well he's out all night to collect a fare
Just so long, just so long it don't mess up his hair


I walked the world with you, babe
A thousand miles with you
I dried your tears of pain, babe
A million times for you
I'd sell my soul for you babe
For money to burn with you
I'd give you all, and have none, babe
Just, just, justa, justa to have you here by me
Because

In the midnight hour she cried more, more, more
With a rebel yell she cried more, more, more
In the midnight hour babe more, more, more
With a rebel yell
More, more, more
More, more, more

Oh yeah little angel
She want more
More, more, more, more, more
Oh yeah little baby
She want more
More, more, more, more"

She turned her tender eyes to me
As deep as any ocean
As sweet as any harmony
Mmm - but she blinded me with science
""She blinded me with science!""
And failed me in biology
When I'm dancing close to her
(Blinding me with science) - science!
I can smell the chemicals

And when she turned her eyes to me
As deep as any ocean
As sweet as any harmony

And failed me in geometry
When she's dancing next to me

I can hear machinery
(Blinding me with science) - science!
It's poetry in motion
And now she's making love to me
The spheres're in commotion
The elements in harmony
She blinded me with science
(She blinded me with science!)
And hit me with technology
(Good heavens Miss Sakamoto - you're beautiful!)
I don't believe it!
There she goes again!
She's tidied up, and I can't find anything!
All my tubes and wires
And careful notes
And antiquated notions
But! - it's poetry in motion
And when she turned her eyes to me
As deep as any ocean
As sweet as any harmony

Baby I'm hot just like an oven
I need some lovin'
And baby, I can't hold it much longer
It's getting stronger and stronger

And when I get that feeling
I want Sexual Healing
Sexual Healing, oh baby
Makes me feel so fine
Helps to relieve my mind
Sexual Healing baby, is good for me
Sexual Healing is something that's good for me

Whenever blue tear drops are falling
And my emotional stability is leaving me
There is something I can do
I can get on the telephone and call you up baby, and
Honey I know you'll be there to heal me
The love you give to me will free me
If you don't know the thing you're dealing
Oh I can tell you, darling, that it's Sexual Healing
(Get up, Get up, Get up, Get up)
Let's make love tonight
(Wake up, Wake up, Wake up, Wake up)
'Cause you do it right

Baby I got sick this morning
A sea was storming inside of me
Baby I think I'm capsizing
The waves are rising and rising

And when I get that feeling
I want Sexual Healing
Sexual Healing is good for me
Makes me feel so fine, it's such a rush
Helps to relieve the mind, and it's good for us
Sexual Healing, baby, it's good for me
Sexual Healing is something that's good for me
And it's good for me and it's so good to me
My baby ohhh

Come take control, just grab a hold
Of my body and mind soon we'll be making it
Honey, oh we're feeling fine
You're my medicine open up and let me in

I can't wait for you to operate

The 21st night of September?

Only blue talk and love
Remember, the true love we share today

46	Iron Maiden	"From the coast of gold
Across the seven seas
I'm travellin' on
Far and wide
But now it seems
I'm just a stranger to myself
And all the things I sometimes do
It isn't me but someone else
I close my eyes, and think of home
Another city goes by in the night
Ain't it funny how it is
You never miss it 'til it's gone away
And my heart is lying there
And will be 'til my dying day

So understand
Don't waste your time always searching for
Those wasted years
Face up... make your stand
And realize you're living in the golden years

Too much time on my hands
I got you on my mind
Can't ease this pain, so easily
When you can't find the words to say
It's hard to make it through another day
And it makes me wanna cry
And throw my hands up to the sky

So understand
Don't waste your time always searching for
Those wasted years
Face up... make your stand
And realize you're living in the golden years
So understand
Don't waste your time always searching for
Those wasted years
Face up... make your stand
And realize you're living in the golden years
So understand
Don't waste your time always searching for
Those wasted years
Face up... make your stand
And realize you're living in the golden years"
47	Iron Maiden	"I am a man who walks alone
And when I'm walking a dark road
At night or strolling through the park
When the light begins to change
I sometimes feel a little strange
A little anxious when it's dark

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there
Have you run your fingers down the wall
And have you felt your neck skin crawl
When you're searching for the light ?
Sometimes when you're scared to take a look
At the corner of the room
You've sensed that something's watching you

Have you ever been alone at night
Thought you heard footsteps behind
And turned around and no-one's there?
And as you quicken up your pace
You find it hard to look again
Because you're sure there's someone there

Fear of the dark
Fear of the dark
Fear of the dark
Fear of the dark
Fear of the dark
Fear of the dark
Fear of the dark
Fear of the dark
Watching horror films the night before
Debating witches and folklore
The unknown troubles on your mind
Maybe your mind is playing tricks
You sense, and suddenly eyes fix
On dancing shadows from behind

Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have constant fear that something's always near
Fear of the dark, fear of the dark
I have a phobia that someone's always there
When I'm walking a dark road
I am a man who walks alone"
48	Iron Maiden	"Woe to you, Oh Earth and Sea
For the Devil sends the beast with wrath
Because he knows the time is short
Let him who hath understanding reckon the number of the beast
For it is a human number
Its number is Six hundred and sixty six

I left alone, my mind was blank
I needed time to think to get the memories from my mind
What did I see? Can I believe that what I saw
That night was real and not just fantasy?
Just what I saw, in my old dreams, were they
Reflections of my warped mind staring back at me?
Cause in my dream, it's always there
The evil face that twists my mind and brings me to despair
YEAH!

The night was black, was no use holding back
Cause I just had to see, was someone watching me?
In the mist, dark figures move and twist
Was this all for real or just some kind of hell?

666 the number of the beast
Hell and fire was spawned to be released

Torches blazed and sacred chants were praised
As they start to cry, hands held to the sky
In the night, the fires burning bright
The ritual has begun, Satan's work is done

666 the number of the beast
Sacrifice is going on tonight


This can't go on, I must inform the law
Can this still be real, or just some crazy dream?
But I feel drawn towards the chanting hordes
They seem to mesmerize, can't avoid their eyes

666 the number of the beast
666 the one for you and me

I'm coming back, I will return
And I'll possess your body and I'll make you burn
I have the fire, I have the force
I have the power to make my evil take its course"
49	Metallica	"I can't remember anything
Can't tell if this is true or dream
Deep down inside I feel to scream
This terrible silence stops me
Now that the war is through with me
I'm waking up, I cannot see
That there's not much left of me
Nothing is real but pain now

Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, wake me

Back in the womb it's much too real
In pumps life that I must feel
But can't look forward to reveal
Look to the time when I'll live
Fed through the tube that sticks in me
Just like a wartime novelty
Tied to machines that make me be
Cut this life off from me

Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, wake me

Now the world is gone, I'm just one
Oh, God help me

Hold my breath as I wish for death
Oh please God, help me

Darkness imprisoning me
All that I see
Absolute horror
I cannot live
I cannot die
Trapped in myself
Body my holding cell
Landmine has taken my sight
Taken my speech
Taken my hearing
Taken my arms
Taken my legs
Taken my soul
Left me with life in hell"
50	Metallica	"Say your prayers little one
Don't forget, my son
To include everyone
I tuck you in
Warm within
Keep you free from sin

Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to Never Never-land

Something's wrong, shut the light
Heavy thoughts tonight
And they aren't of Snow White
Dreams of war
Dreams of liars
Dreams of dragons fire
And of things that will bite, yeah

Sleep with one eye open
Gripping your pillow tight

Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to Never Never-land

My friends, put you hands like this man

Now I lay me down to sleep
Now I lay me down to sleep
Pray the lord my soul to keep

And
If I die before I wake
If I die before I wake
Pray the lord my soul to take
Pray the lord my soul to take
My friends, put you hands like this man

Hush little baby don't say a word
And never mind that noise you heard
It's just the beast under your bed
In your closet in your head

Exit light
Enter night
Grain of sand
Exit light
Enter night
Take my hand
We're off to Never Never-land
Come on people
Hey yeah, oh oh yeah

We're off to never never-land
Take my hand
We're off to never never-land
Take my hand
We're off to never never-land"

Killing first born man
Die, by my hand
I creep across the land
Killing first born man

Goddamn, I'm glad y'all set it off
Used to be hard, now you're just wet and soft
First you was down with the AK
And now I see you on a video with Michel'le
Looking like straight Bozos
I saw it coming, that's why I went solo
And kept on stompin'
While y'all mothafuckers moved straight outta Compton
Living with the whites
One big house and not another nigga in sight
I started off with too much cargo
Dropped four niggas now I'm making all the dough
White man just ruling
The Niggas With Attitudes? Who ya foolin'?
Y'all niggas just phony
I put that on my Mama and my dead homies
Yella Boy's on your team, so you're losing
Ay yo Dre, stick to producing
Calling me Arnold, but you bent-a-dick
Eazy-E saw your ass and went in it quick
You got jealous when I got my own company
But I'm a man, and ain't nobody humping me
Trying to sound like Amerikkka's Most?
You could yell all day, but you don't come close
Cause you know I'm the one that flowed
Ya done run 100 miles, but you still got one to go
With the L-E-N-C-H M-O-B
And y'all disgrace the C-P-T
Cause you're getting fucked out your green
By a white boy, with no vaseline

Now you're getting done without vaseline
Now you're getting done without vaseline
Now you're getting done without vaseline
Damn, it feels good to see people, on it

The bigger the cap, the bigger the peeling
Who gives a fuck about a punk-ass villain?
You're getting fucked real quick
And Eazy's dick is smelling like MC Ren's shit
Tried to tell you a year ago
But Willie D told me to let a ho be a ho, so
I couldn't stop you from getting ganked
Now let's play big-bank-take-little-bank
Tried to diss Ice Cube, it wasn't worth it
Cause the broomstick fit your ass so perfect
Cut my hair? Naw, cut them balls
Cause I heard you like giving up the drawers
Gang-banged by your manager, fella
Getting money out your ass like a mothafucking Ready Teller
Giving up the dollar bills
Now they got The Villain with a purse and high-heels
So don't believe what Ren say
Cause he's going out like Kunte Kinte
But I got a whip for ya, Toby
Used to be my homie, now you act like you don't know me
It's a case of divide-and-conquer
Cause you let a Jew break up my crew
House nigga gotta run and hide
Yelling Compton, but you moved to Riverside
So don't front, MC Ren
Cause I remember when you drove a B-210
Broke as a mothafucking joke
Let you on the scene to back up the First Team
It ain't my fault, one nigga got smart
And they ripping your asshole apart
By taking your green
Oh yeah, The Villain does get fucked with no vaseline

Now you're getting done, get-getting done
Now you're getting done, get-getting done
Now you're getting done without va-va-va-va-vaseline

I never have dinner with the President
I never have dinner with the President
I never have dinner with the President
And when I see your ass again, I'll be hesitant
Now I think you a snitch
Throw a house nigga in a ditch
Half-pint bitch, fucking your homeboys, you little maggot
Eazy-E turned faggot
With your manager, fella
Fucking MC Ren, Dr. Dre, and Yella
But if they were smart as me
Eazy-E a'be hanging from a tree
With no vaseline
Just a match and a little bit of gasoline
Light 'em up, burn 'em up, flame on
Till that Jheri curl is gone
On a permanent vacation
Off the massa plantation
Heard you both got the same bank account
Dumb nigga, what you thinking bout?!
Get rid of that Devil real simple
Put a bullet in his temple
Cause you can't be the Nigga 4 Life crew
With a white jew telling you what to do
Pulling wools with your scams
Now I gotta play the Silence of the Lambs
With a midget who's a punk, too
Tryin' to fuck me, but I'd rather fuck you
Eric Wright, punk, always into something
Gettin' fucked at night

57	Survivor	"Two worlds collide, rival nations
It's a primitive clash venting years of frustrations
Bravely we hope against all hope
There is so much at stake
Seems our freedom's up against the ropes
Does the crowd understand?
Is it East versus West or man against man?
Can any nation stand alone?

In the burning Heart just about to burst
There's a quest for answers an unquenchable thirst
In the darkest night rising like a spire
In the burning heart the unmistakable fire

In the warriors code there's no surrender
Though his body says stop his spirit cries - never!
Deep in our soul a quiet ember knows it's you against you
It's the paradox that drives us on
It's a battle of wills
In the heat of attack it's the passion that kills
The victory is yours alone

In the burning Heart just about to burst
There's a quest for answers an unquenchable thirst
In the darkest night rising like a spire
In the burning heart the unmistakable fire

58	Logic	"Sometimes I fantasize about traveling space and time
I think about specific moments that I could rewind
Not to redo it, but relive it, I could give it one more go, abide
And truly understand the deeper things
That I don't know about
Now take a trip with me and vibe
I'm on this interstellar mission, is you down to ride?
Hold up, I know this innermission feeling like the tribe
Life is beautiful I'm so lucky to be alive
I'm gonna take this moment right now
Here and school them people
I know deep in my heart everyone is created equal
I truly wish that I could see the sequel of our people
Truly wish that I could, check it
Now, when I hit the road and tour the world
I see like different light, this music shit just ain't the world
Brothers and sisters from different mothers and misters
All different colors and creeds all come together for me
Boy, I'm blessed to be free, uh

This is our time
Still I'm looking back, let me rewind
This is our ride
Don't let me lose my faith, let me rewind

Doing 70 on this highway
On the front of this bus, I'm busting my mind open
Hoping these lyrics will keep me coping
On the grind like copin', no time to bring the dope in
But this Nyquil got me feeling lit
It's been like 3 months since I've been home
Sometimes it feel like forever just how long I been gone
Yeah, you know that's the shit that I been on
You know I love it, feel like there's never enough of it
Let me bring 'em back
Chilling, watching Tarantino, we know I've been on it forever
My endeavor like a feature film
Step into the realm of the realest, do you feel this?
I'm in it, my limit the chillest
Let me bring 'em back, yo
Yeah, I woke up early on my born, 25, it's a blessing
Progression everyday, lesson's got me stressing
But I'm testing, reminiscing
When I would listen to my intuition
And now I made it, resurrecting
Young Sinatra I created, I'm elated
It seem like everyone's somehow related
Letters back and forth from my homie
That's locked up in prison
Doing 14, it's been 5, I know my heart's with him
I've been so busy, it feel like forever since I hit him, man
I think about how I wasn't shit when he went in
What if the tables was turned
And I was the one that been in, damn
He said he's seen me in the magazine
He said he's seen me on Fallon and Kimmel
That's been my dog from the kennel
I never thought that out the millions watching, he was one
It makes me reminisce about the times when we begun
Skipping class with all of my homies
On a constant search for who I was
I rarely went to school, they wonder why and that's because
My situation at home was alcoholics and drugs
I never graduated but I made it to the summit
Don't get me wrong, so many times
I thought that I would plummet
Felt like I didn't have the heart and couldn't seem
To stomach all of the beef around my way
I mean, I never wanted to live a life
Where all you're truly living is a lie
I knew I always wanted more
And so they wonder why, I said they wonder why

This is our time
Still I'm looking back, let me rewind
This is our ride
Don't let me lose my faith, let me rewind

So what do you think about space?
Um, space is called the galaxy...
Do you know planets?
What are—can you name some planets off?
Yeah, there's a one named Saturn and Earth
Mars—and the planet Paradise
You've never been there before?
Um, no. I was little a long time ago with my mom riding in the coolest ship. My TV showed us where we are in space—
But there was droid ships everywhere...
Well, thank you for your time, sir
I appreciate the interview..."
59	2Pac	"I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
Let's get ready to rumble!

Now, you know how we do it, like a G
What really go on in the mind of a nigga
That get down for theirs
Constantly, money over bitches
Not bitches over money
Stay on your grind, nigga
My ambitions as a ridah
My ambitions as a ridah

So many battlefield scars while driven in plush cars
This life as a rap star is nothin' without guard
Was born rough and rugged, addressin' the mass public
My attitude was ""fuck it,"" because motherfuckers love it
To be a soldier, must maintain composure at ease
Though life is complicated, only what you make it to be
Uh, and my ambitions as a ridah
To catch her while she hot and horny, go up inside her
Then I spit some game in her ear, ""Go to the telly, ho!""
Equipped with money in a Benz ‘cause, bitch, I'm barely broke
I'm smokin' bomb-ass weed, feelin' crucial
From player to player the game's tight, the feeling's mutual
From hustlin' and prayers to breakin' motherfuckers to pay up
I got no time for these bitches, ‘cause these hoes try to play us
I'm on a meal ticket mission, want a mill so I'm wishin'
Competition got me ripped on that bullshit they stressin'
I'ma rhyme though, clown hoes like it's mandatory
No guts, no glory, my nigga, bitch got the game distorted
Now it's on and it's on because I said so
Can't trust a bitch in the business so I got with Death Row
Now these money-hungry bitches gettin' suspicious
Started plottin' and plannin' on schemes to come and trick us
But thug niggas be on point and game tight
Me, Syke and Bogart strapped up the same night
Got problems, then handle it, motherfuckers see me
These niggas is jealous ‘cause deep in the heart they wanna be me
Uh, yeah, and now you got me right beside ya, hopin' you listen
I catch you payin' attention to my ambitions as a ridah

I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
Let's get ready to rumble

It was my only wish to rise
Above these jealous coward motherfuckers I despise
When it's time to ride I was the first off this side, give me the 9
I'm ready to die right here tonight and motherfuck they life
That's what they screamin' as they drill me, but I'm hard to kill
(That's all you niggas got?!)
So open fire, I see you kill me, witness my steel
Spittin' at adversaries, envious and after me
I'd rather die before they capture me, watch me bleed
Mama, come rescue me, I'm suicidal, thinkin' thoughts
I'm innocent so there'll be bullets flyin' when I'm caught
(Shoot!) Fuck doin' jail time, better day, sacrifice
Won't get a chance to do me like they did my nigga Tys
Thuggin' for life, and if you right then nigga die for it
Let them other brothers try, at least you tried for it
When it's time to die, to be a man and pick the way you leave
Fuck peace and the police, my ambitions as a ridah

I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
Let's get ready to rumble

My murderous lyrics, equipped with spirits of the thugs before me
Pay off the block, evade the cops ‘cause I know they comin' for me
I been hesitant to reappear, been away for years
Now I'm back, my adversaries been reduced to tears
Question my methods to switch up speeds
Sure as some bitches bleed
Niggas'll feel the fire of my mother's corrupted seed
Blast me but they didn't finish, didn't diminish my powers
(Buck buck buck buck buck!)
So now I'm back to be a motherfuckin' menace, they cowards
That's why they tried to set me up
Had bitch-ass niggas on my team so indeed they wet me up
But I'm back reincarnated, incarcerated
At the time I contemplate the way that God made it
Lace 'em with lyrics that's legendary, musical mercenary
For money I'll have these motherfuckers buried
I been gettin' much mail in jail, niggas tellin' me to kill it
Knowin' when I get out they gon' feel it
Witness the realest! A hoo-ridah when I put the shit inside
The cry from all your people when they find her
Just remind ya, my history'll prove authentic
Revenge on them niggas that played me
And all the cowards that was down with it
Now it's your nigga right beside ya, hopin' you listenin'
Catch you payin' attention to my ambitions as a ridah

I won't deny it, I'm a straight ridah
You don't wanna fuck with me
Got the police bustin' at me
But they can't do nothin' to a G
Let's get ready to rumble"
60	DragonForce	"On a cold winter morning, in the time before the light
In flames of death's eternal reign we ride towards the fight
When the darkness has fallen down, and the times are tough all right
The sound of evil laughter falls around the world tonight
Fighting hard, fighting on for the steel, through the wastelands evermore
The scattered souls will feel the hell bodies wasted on the shores
On the blackest plains in hell's domain, we watch them as we go
In fire and pain, and once again we know
So now we fly ever free
We're free before the thunderstorm
On towards the wilderness our quest carries on
Far beyond the sundown, far beyond the moonlight
Deep inside our hearts and all our souls

So far away we wait for the day
For the lives all so wasted and gone
We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
Through the fire and the flames we carry on

As the red day is dawning
And the lightning cracks the sky
They'll raise their hands to the heavens above
With resentment in their eyes
Running back from the mid-morning light
There's a burning in my heart
We're banished from a time in a fallen land
To a life beyond the stars
In your darkest dreams see to believe
Our destiny is time
And endlessly we'll all be free tonight
And on the wings of a dream, so far beyond reality
All alone in desperation, now the time has gone
Lost inside you'll never find, lost within my own mind
Day after day this misery must go on

So far away we wait for the day
For the lives all so wasted and gone
We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
Through the fire and the flames we carry on


Now here we stand with their blood on our hands
We fought so hard now can we understand
I'll break the seal of this curse if I possibly can
For freedom of every man

So far away we wait for the day
For the lives all so wasted and gone
We feel the pain of a lifetime lost in a thousand days
Through the fire and the flames we carry on"
61	Coolio	"As I walk through the valley of the shadow of death
I take a look at my life and realize there's nothin' left
‘Cause I've been blastin' and laughin' so long
That even my momma thinks that my mind is gone
But I ain't never crossed a man that didn't deserve it
Me be treated like a punk, you know that's unheard of
You better watch how you talkin' and where you walkin'
Or you and your homies might be lined in chalk
I really hate to trip, but I gotta loc
As they croak, I see myself in the pistol smoke
Fool, I'm the kinda G that little homies wanna be like
On my knees in the night, sayin' prayers in the streetlight

Keep spendin' most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Been spendin' most their lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
We keep spendin' most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
We keep spendin' most our lives

Look at the situation they got me facin'
I can't live a normal life, I was raised by the street
So I gotta be down with the hood team
Too much television watchin' got me chasin' dreams
I'm a educated fool with money on my mind
Got my ten in my hand and a gleam in my eye
I'm a loc'd out gangsta, set trippin' banger
And my homies are down so don't arouse my anger
Fool, death ain't nothin' but a heart beat away
I'm livin' life do or die, what can I say?
I'm 23 now, but will I live to see 24?
The way things is goin' I don't know

Tell me why are we so blind to see
That the ones we hurt are you and me?

Keep spendin' most our lives

Been spendin' most their lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
We keep spendin' most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
We keep spendin' most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise

Power and the money, money and the power
Minute after minute, hour after hour
Everybody's runnin', but half of them ain't lookin'
It's goin' on in the kitchen, but I don't know what's cookin'
They say I gotta learn, but nobody's here to teach me
If they can't understand it, how can they reach me?
I guess they can't, I guess they won't
I guess they front; that's why I know my life is out of luck, fool!

Keep spendin' most our lives
Livin' in a gangsta's paradise
Been spendin' most their lives

Will you come and entertain?""

Graduated in the Bay
Had her birthday in LA
Said I had to go to Paris
Private jets on her parents
Asked me if I wanna roll
I said if you take me home

Claimin' they live but if you pop 'em they snitchin'
Some watch from the building and gain knowledge of dealers
Knowin' they lack the heart of those thats out on the benches
I was out in the trenches-which enables me
To paint such a powerful picture like Apocalypse Now
I put my heart in my lyrics everytime I sit down to write
My *Source* a inspiration, ain't three and a half mics
I must have been an MC in my past life
Presently I'm unquestionably poetic, I'm mad nice
People act like I don't deserve nothing I got
I grew up in the spot, my sleep was interrupted by customers knocks
Some of y'all should just stop the animosity you got for me, luck it was not
For years we ran our projects like a marathon, its catastrophic
Our time, death, and pride came out on conquest
Subsequently some are with me others ain't, yet the gutter's within me
I wish for nothing except that my mother was with me
Some place judgement against me based on nothing but envy
They pray for My Downfall like the song by Biggie
Born in the city which never sleeps 'til rest in peace
Is carved in stone, some starved while others bled to eat
Rap is my legacy, I leave my seed my destiny
Except I hope she never see the treachery success could bring
The trife life and death of kings
I'm from the rarest breed of people who rep the street and spit poetically
Never sleep, rest assured Mega is dope in his pure form
The dealer/MC keepin it real is my protocol
Fall back I got you open off the style I was workin on it
The beat is lifeless, 'til I put my verses on it
I reminisce confinement as I read a kite
From my people with secret indictment, freedom and triumph
Contemplating putting sprees on the tires
Dominating this beat with my rhyming as if you need a reminder
I spit that drug dealer shit you might have seen on The Wire
What other lyricist is known for giving people consignment
I'm eager to find my equal in rhyming, I rock Iceberg jeans with the Nikes
An extremist with rhymin deep as Poseidon
Breedin' in violence now I live in a peaceful enviroment
A secret asylum from the streets where people be wilding
Some blind with fury from seeing me shining
Like a phoenix arising from the depths showin' the reaper defiance"

Now that I'm on my own
I know that in time I'll find somebody new
Who'll treat me better than you
So now that I'm all alone without you
But I still love you
You know I'll never live without you
All those pretty memories
I know you can hear me now
For the record I love you
All those pretty memories
I know you can hear me now
For the record I love you
I wish you'd change your ways soon enough
So we can be together
You just don't understand the word love
But now all we have is memories
All those pretty memories
I know you can hear me now
For the record I love you
All those pretty memories
I know you can hear me now
For the record I love you"

Pressing down on you, no man ask for
Under pressure that burns a building down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets

Um ba ba be

De day da
Ee day da - that's okay

It's the terror of knowing what the world is about
Watching some good friends screaming, 'Let me out'
Pray tomorrow gets me higher
Pressure on people, people on streets

Day day de mm hm

Chipping around, kick my brains around the floor
These are the days it never rains but it pours

It's the terror of knowing what the world is about
Watching some good friends screaming, 'Let me out'
Pray tomorrow gets me higher, high
Pressure on people, people on streets

Turned away from it all like a blind man
Sat on a fence but it don't work
Keep coming up with love but it's so slashed and torn
Why - why - why?
Love, love, love, love, love
Insanity laughs under pressure we're breaking

Can't we give ourselves one more chance?
Why can't we give love that one more chance?
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love
Give love, give love, give love, give love, give love?

Because love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares you to care for
The people on the (people on streets) edge of the night
And love (people on streets) dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance
This is ourselves under pressure
Under pressure
Pressure"
71	Red Hot Chili Peppers	"Can't stop, addicted to the shindig
Chop Top, he says I'm gonna win big
Choose not a life of imitation
Distant cousin to the reservation
Defunct, the pistol that you pay for
This punk, the feelin' that you stay for
In time I want to be your best friend
East side love is living on the West End
Knocked out, but boy, you better come to
Don't die, you know, the truth is some do
Go write your message on the pavement
Burnin' so bright, I wonder what the wave meant
White heat is screamin' in the jungle
Complete the motion if you stumble
Go ask the dust for any answers
Come back strong with fifty belly dancers

The world I love, the tears I drop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Ever wonder if it's all for you?
The world I love, the trains I hop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Come and tell me when it's time to

Sweetheart is bleeding in the snow cone
So smart, she's leadin' me to ozone
Music, the great communicator
Use two sticks to make it in the nature
I'll get you into penetration
The gender of a generation
The birth of every other nation
Worth your weight, the gold of meditation
This chapter's gonna be a close one
Smoke rings, I know you're gonna blow one
All on a spaceship, persevering
Use my hands for everything but steering
Can't stop the spirits when they need you
Mop tops are happy when they feed you
J. Butterfly is in the treetop
Birds that blow the meaning into bebop

The world I love, the tears I drop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Ever wonder if it's all for you?
The world I love, the trains I hop
To be part of the wave, can't stop
Come and tell me when it's time to

Wait a minute, I'm passin' out win or lose, just like you
Far more shockin' than anything I ever knew, how about you?
Ten more reasons why I need somebody new, just like you
Far more shockin' than anything I ever knew, right on cue

Can't stop, addicted to the shindig
Chop Top, he says I'm gonna win big
Choose not a life of imitation
Distant cousin to the reservation
Defunct, the pistol that you pay for
This punk, the feelin' that you stay for
In time I want to be your best friend
East side love is living on the West End
Knocked out, but boy, you better come to
Don't die, you know, the truth is some do
Go write your message on the pavement
Burnin' so bright, I wonder what the wave meant
Kick start the golden generator
Sweet talk but don't intimidate her
Can't stop the gods from engineering
Feel no need for any interfering
Your image in the dictionary
This life is more than ordinary
Can I get two, maybe even three of these?
Comin' from the space to teach you of the Pleiades
Can't stop the spirits when they need you
This life is more than just a read-through"

Running through the field where all my tracks will be concealed
And there's nowhere to go

When to descend to amend for a friend

With itchy feet and fading smiles
Can you feel me?

Don't give in without a fight

Hey you, out there on your own
Sitting naked by the phone
Would you touch me?
Hey you, with your ear against the wall
Waiting for someone to call out
Would you touch me?
Hey you, would you help me to carry the stone?
Open your heart, I'm coming home


But it was only fantasy
The wall was too high, as you can see
No matter how he tried, he could not break free
And the worms ate into his brain


Hey you, out there on the road
Always doing what you're told
Can you help me?

Breaking bottles in the hall
Can you help me?

And get you on your feet again
Relax
I need some information first
Just the basic facts
Can you show me where it hurts?

There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying
When I was a child I had a fever
My hands felt just like two balloons
Now I've got that feeling once again
I can't explain, you would not understand
This is not how I am
I have become comfortably numb


I have become comfortably numb

Okay
Just a little pin prick *ding*
There'll be no more ""AHHHHHHHHHHHHH!""
But you may feel a little sick
Can you stand up?
I do believe it's working, good
That'll keep you going through the show
Come on, it's time to go

There is no pain, you are receding
A distant ship, smoke on the horizon
You are only coming through in waves
Your lips move but I can't hear what you're saying

Out of the corner of my eye
I turned to look but it was gone
I cannot put my finger on it now

The dream is gone
I have become comfortably numb"

What am I doing here?

The final curtain call I see
How true is this?

If this is true, just let it be
Wakened by a horrid scream
Freed from this frightening dream

Eres, lo que más quiero en este mundo, eso eres,

Tan sólo dime lo que hago, aqui me tienes.
Eres, cuando despierto lo primero, eso eres,
Lo que a mi vida le hace falta si no vienes,
Lo único, preciosa, que mi mente habita hoy.
Qué mas puedo decirte,
Tal vez puedo mentirte sin razón,
Pero lo que hoy siento es que sin ti estoy muerto, pues
Eres lo que más quiero en este mundo, eso eres.
Eres, el tiempo que comparto, eso eres,
Lo que la gente promete cuando se quiere,
Mi salvación , mi esperanza , y mi fe.
Soy el que quererte quiere como nadie soy,
El que te llevaría el sustento día a día ,
El que por ti
Daría la vida, ese soy.
Aquí estoy a tu lado y espero aquí sentado hasta el final.
No te has imaginado lo que por ti he esperado pues eres
Lo que yo amo en este mundo, eso eres,
Cada minuto en lo que pienso, eso eres,
Lo que más cuido en este mundo, eso eres."

Black granite, wind blows
Fire lake and far flame
Go now but come again
Dark clouds gather 'round
Will I run or stand my ground?

Oh, when I come to climb
Show me the mountain so far behind
Yeah, it's farther away
Its shadow gets smaller day after day

Now, sure as the sun will cross the sky
This lie is over
Lost, like the tears that used to tide me over
One thing is sure
That time will tell
If you were wrong
The brightest ring around the moon
Will darken when I die
Now, sure as the sun will cross the sky
This lie is over
Gone, like the tears that used to tide me over
You're leaving now
It's in your eyes
There's no disguising it
It really comes as no surprise
To find that you'd planned it all along
I see it now
It comes so clear
Your insincerity
And me all starry eyed
You think that I would have known by now
Now, sure as the sun will cross the sky
This lie is over
Lost, like the tears that used to tide me over
You're on your own
Inside your room
You're claiming victory
You were just using me
And there is no one you can use now
One thing is sure
That time will tell..."
88	Billy Ocean	"""She's simply...awesome"" Ooohh

She dashed by me in painted on jeans
And all heads turned cause she was the dream
In the blink of an eye I knew her number and her name, yeah
She said I was the tiger she wanted to tame

Caribbean Queen
Now we're sharing the same dream
And our hearts they beat as one
No more love on the run

I lose my cool when she steps in the room
And I get so excited just from her perfume
Electric eyes that you can't ignore
And passion burns you like never before

I was in search of a good time
Just running my game
Love was the furthest
Furthest from my mind

Caribbean Queen
Now we're sharing the same dream
And our hearts they beat as one
No more love on the run

Caribbean Queen
Now we're sharing the same dream
And our hearts they beat as one
No more love on the run


Caribbean Queen
Now we're sharing the same dream
And our hearts they beat as one
No more love on the run

And our hearts they beat as one
No more love on the run

She is the queen

Lay awake
I don't give a shit
If I even ever wake up in the morning
Down below
There's a pile of sin
Always waiting for a, waiting for a warning

Burned at the stake
Inside I'm blistering
Not a whisper, looking in you'd never know it
Miles below
I look up again
When you snap, they say before you never show it

Someone said it's all right
Save it now, don't say it for my sake
Someone said it's all right
Faster now, you know I got no brakes
No brakes

Fuses glow
Wounds are festering
Till the wind comes up and takes it to the last ""pow""
Back and forth
Staring at the wall
This room's a cage, I know that something's got to give now


No brakes

I won't harm you or touch your defenses

Going to take you apart
I'll put us back together at heart, baby

You know it always brings me down
Cause it's free and I see that it's me

I feel it dancing in the light
It was cold, lost my hold
To the shadows of the night
No sign of the morning coming
You've been left on your own
Like a rainbow in the dark
A rainbow in the dark
Do your Demons, do they ever let you go?
When you've tried, do they hide deep inside?
Is it someone that you know?
You're just a picture
You're an image caught in time
We're a lie, you and I
We're words without a rhyme
There's no sign of the morning coming
You've been left on your own
Like a rainbow in the dark
Just a rainbow in the dark
When I see lightning
You know it always brings me down
Cause it's free and I see that it's me
Who's lost and never found
Feel the magic
I feel it floating in the air
But it's fear and you'll hear it calling
You beware, look out
There's no sign of the morning coming
There's no sign of the day

Ooh they're red, white and blue

Ooh, they point the cannon at you, Lord

I ain't no senator's son, son
It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no fortunate one, no

Lord, the house looks like a rummage sale, yeah

It ain't me, it ain't me
I ain't no millionaire's son, no no

Ooh, they only answer More, more, more!

98	Green Day	"Do you have the time to listen to me whine?
About nothing and everything all at once
I am one of those melodramatic fools
Neurotic to the bone, no doubt about it

Sometimes I give myself the creeps
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up, I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid or am I just stoned?

I went to a shrink to analyze my dreams
She says it's lack of sex that's bringing me down
I went to a whore, he said my life's a bore
Just quit my whining, ‘cause it's bringing her down

Sometimes I give myself the creeps
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up, I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid or am I just dumb?

Grasping to control, so I better hold on

Sometimes I give myself the creeps
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up, I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid or am I just stoned?"
99	Simon & Garfunkel	"I am just a poor boy though my story's seldom told
I have squandered my resistance for a pocketful of mumbles, such are promises
All lies and jest, still a man hears what he wants to hear
And disregards the rest, hmmmm

When I left my home and my family, I was no more than a boy
In the company of strangers
In the quiet of the railway station, runnin' scared, laying low
Seeking out the poorer quarters, where the ragged people go
Looking for the places only they would know

Lie la lie, lie la lie la lie la lie
Lie la lie, lie la lie la lie la lie, la la lie la lie

Asking only workman's wages, I come lookin' for a job
But I get no offers
Just a come-on from the whores on 7th Avenue
I do declare, there were times when I was so lonesome
I took some comfort there

Now the years are rolling by me
They are rockin' evenly
I am older than I once was
And younger than I'll be; that's not unusual
Nor is it strange
After changes upon changes
We are more or less the same
After changes we are more or less the same

Lie la lie, lie la lie la lie la lie
Lie la lie, lie la lie la lie la lie, la la lie la lie

And I'm laying out my winter clothes and wishing I was gone
Goin' home
Where the New York City winters aren't bleedin' me, leadin' me
Goin' home

In the clearing stands a boxer, and a fighter by his trade
And he carries the reminders
Of every glove that laid him down or cut him
'Til he cried out in his anger and his shame
I am leaving, I am leaving, but the fighter still remains

Lie la lie, lie la lie la lie la lie
Lie la lie, lie la lie la lie la lie, la la lie la lie"
100	Dire Straits	"You get a shiver in the dark
It's raining in the park
But meantime
South of the river
You stop and you hold everything
A band is blowing Dixie
Double four time
You feel alright
When you hear that music ring

Well, now you step inside
But you don't see too many faces
Coming in out of the rain to hear the jazz go down
Competition in other places
But the horns, they blowin' that sound
Way on down south
Way on down south, London town

Check out guitar George
He knows all the chords
Mind, it's strictly rhythm
He doesn't want to make it cry or sing
Left-handed old guitar is all he can afford
When he gets up under the lights to play his thing

And Harry doesn't mind if he doesn't make the scene
He's got a daytime job – He's doing alright
He can play the honky tonk like anything
Saving it up for Friday night
With the Sultans
With the Sultans of Swing

And a crowd of young boys
They're fooling around in the corner
Drunk and dressed in their best brown baggies
And their platform soles
They don't give a damn
About any trumpet playing band
It ain't what they call Rock and Roll
And the Sultans
Yeah, the Sultans, they play Creole
Creole


And then the man
He steps right up to the microphone
And says at last
Just as the time bell rings
""Goodnight, now it's time to go home""
Then he makes it fast
With one more thing
""We are the Sultans –
We are the Sultans of Swing"""
101	Fleetwood Mac	"Now here you go again, you say you want your freedom
Well, who am I to keep you down?
It's only right that you should play the way you feel it
But listen carefully to the sound of your loneliness

Like a heartbeat drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering of what you had
And what you lost and what you had and what you lost

Thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Say women they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know, you'll know


Now here I go again, I see the crystal visions
I keep my visions to myself
It's only me who wants to wrap around your dreams
And have you any dreams you'd like to sell?
Dreams of loneliness

Like a heartbeat drives you mad
In the stillness of remembering of what you had
And what you lost and what you had and what you lost

Thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Women they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know, you'll know
Oh, thunder only happens when it's raining
Players only love you when they're playing
Say women they will come and they will go
When the rain washes you clean, you'll know, you'll know
You will know, you'll know"
102	Lynyrd Skynyrd	"If I leave here tomorrow
Would you still remember me?
For I must be traveling on, now
Cause there's too many places I've got to see
But, if I stayed here with you, girl
Things just couldn't be the same
Cause I'm as free as a bird now
And this bird you can not change

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
And this bird you can not change
And this bird you can not change
Lord knows, I can't change


Bye, bye, baby, it's been a sweet love
Though this feeling I can't change
But please don't take it so badly
Cause Lord knows I'm to blame
But, if I stayed here with you, girl
Things just couldn't be the same
Cause I'm as free as a bird now
And this bird you'll never change

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
And this bird you can not change
And this bird you can not change
Lord knows, I can't change
Lord help me, I can't change

Lord, I can't change
Won't you fly high, free bird, yeah

Blue ridge mountains, Shenandoah river
Life is old there, older than the trees
Younger than the mountains, blowing like a breeze
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mamma
Take me home, country roads
All my memories, gather round her
Miners' lady, stranger to blue water
Dark and dusty, painted on the sky
Misty taste of moonshine, teardrop in my eye
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mamma
Take me home, to the country roads
I hear her voice in the morning hour she calls me
Radio reminds me of my home far away
Driving down the road I get a feeling
That I should have been home yesterday, yesterday
Country roads, take me home
To the place I belong
West Virginia, mountain mamma
Take me home, country roads

106	Bon Jovi	"It's all the same, only the names will change
Everyday it seems we're wasting away
Another place where the faces are so cold
I'd drive all night just to get back home

I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted dead or alive
Wanted dead or alive

Sometimes I sleep, sometimes it's not for days
And the people I meet always go their separate ways
Sometimes you tell the day by the bottle that you drink
And times when you're alone all you do is think

I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted, wanted, dead or alive
Wanted (wanted) dead or alive

Alive


I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted (wanted) dead or alive

I walk these streets, a loaded six string on my back
I play for keeps, 'cause I might not make it back
I been everywhere, still I'm standing tall
I've seen a million faces and I've rocked them all!

`Cause I'm a cowboy
On a steel horse I ride
I'm wanted (wanted) dead or alive
And I'm a cowboy
I got the night on my side
And I'm wanted (wanted) dead or alive
And I ride (and I ride), dead or alive
I still drive (still drive), dead or alive

It's the hurt that's on your mind
Oh, and last night's show took its toll on me
Well the city lights fly by me
As I lay my body in my bed
Oh, and dreams of you dance through my head

It's a highway song
You sing it on and on
On and on
Highway song
Is as lonely
As the road I'm on
Oh, oh, oh

It's those big wheels are ready to roll
We've be flyin' high and so low
Lord, and all this madness, ain't crazy as it seems
Everywhere they stop and stare
I'm just a stranger on this road
Oh, I stand alone
Only in my dream

You sing it on and on

This is how I'm supposed to be
In the land of make believe
That don't believe in me

Get my television fix
Sitting on my crucifix
The living room in my private womb
While the moms and Brads are away
To fall in love and fall in debt
To alcohol and cigarettes and Mary Jane
To keep me insane
And doing someone else's cocaine

And there's nothing wrong with me
This is how I'm supposed to be
In a land of make believe
That don't believe in me


At the center of the Earth in the parking lot
Of the 7-11 where I was taught
The motto was just a lie
It says ""home is where your heart is,"" but what a shame
Cause everyone's heart doesn't beat the same
It's beating out of time

City of the dead
At the end of another lost highway
Signs misleading to nowhere
City of the damned
Lost children with dirty faces today
No one really seems to care

I read the graffiti in the bathroom stall
Like the holy scriptures of the shopping mall
And so it seemed to confess
It didn't say much, but it only confirmed
That the center of the earth is the end of the world
And I could really care less

City of the dead
At the end of another lost highway
Signs misleading to nowhere
City of the damned
Lost children with dirty faces today
No one really seems to care


I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't care
I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't care
I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't care
I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't
I don't care if you don't care
I don't care

Everyone is so full of shit
Born and raised by hypocrites
Hearts recycled but never saved
From the cradle to the grave
We are the kids of war and peace
From Anaheim to the middle east
We are the stories and disciples of
The Jesus of Suburbia

Land of make believe
And that don't believe in me
Land of make believe
And I don't believe
And I don't care!
I don't care!
I don't care!
I don't care!
I don't care!


Dearly beloved, are you listening?
I can't remember a word that you were saying
Are we demented or am I disturbed?
The space that's in between insane and insecure

Oh, therapy, can you please fill the void?
Am I retarded or am I just overjoyed?
Nobody's perfect and I stand accused
For lack of a better word, and that's my best excuse


To live and not to breathe
Is to die in tragedy
To run, to run away
To find what you believe
And I leave behind
This hurricane of fucking lies
I lost my faith to this
This town that don't exist
So I run, I run away
To the light of masochist
And I leave behind
This hurricane of fucking lies
And I walked this line
A million and one fucking times
But not this time

I don't feel any shame, I won't apologize
When there ain't nowhere you can go
Running away from pain when you've been victimized
Tales from another broken...
Home
You're leaving...
You're leaving...
You're leaving...
Ah you're leaving home..."
111	Gnarls Barkley	"I remember when
I remember, I remember when I lost my mind
There was something so pleasant about that place
Even your emotions had an echo, in so much space
And when you're out there without care
Yeah, I was out of touch
But it wasn't because I didn't know enough
I just knew too much

Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Does that make me crazy?
Possibly

And I hope that you are having the time of your life
But think twice, that's my only advice
Come on now, who do you
Who do you, who do you, who do you think you are?
Ha, ha, ha, bless your soul
You really think you're in control?

Well, I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
I think you're crazy
Just like me

My heroes had the heart to lose their lives out on the limb
And all I remember is thinkin' I wanna be like them
Ever since I was little
Ever since I was little, it looked like fun
And it's no coincidence I've come
And I can die when I'm done

But maybe I'm crazy
Maybe you're crazy
Maybe we're crazy
Probably"
112	Aerosmith	"Come here, baby
You know you drive me up a wall?
The way you make good on all the nasty tricks you pull

Girl, you got to change your crazy ways
You hear me?

Say you're leavin' on a seven thirty train and that you're headin'
Out to Hollywood
Girl you been givin' me that line so many times it kinda gets like
Feelin' bad looks good

Turns a man to a slave

Sends a man right to his grave

I go crazy, crazy, baby, I go crazy
You turn it on
Then you're gone
Yeah you drive me
Crazy, crazy, crazy, for you baby
What can I do, honey
I feel like the color blue

You're packing up your stuff and talking like it's tough and trying
To tell me that it's time to go
But I know you ain't wearing nothing underneath that overcoat
And it's all a show

That kind of loving
Makes me want to pull
Down the shade, yeah
That kind of loving
Yeah now I'm never, never, never, never gonna be the same

I go crazy, crazy, baby, I go crazy
You turn it on
Then you're gone

Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay, Ay
Crazy, but that's how it goes
Millions of people living as foes
Maybe it's not too late
To learn how to love and forget how to hate
Mental wounds not healing
Life's a bitter shame
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train
Let's Go!
I've listened to preachers, I've listened to fools
I've watched all the dropouts who make their own rules
One person conditioned to rule and control
The media sells it and you live the role
Mental wounds still screaming
Driving me insane
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train
I know that things are going wrong for me
You gotta listen to my words
Yeah

Heirs of a cold war, that's what we've become
Inheriting troubles, I'm mentally numb
Crazy, I just cannot bear
I'm living with something' that just isn't fair
Mental wounds not healing
Who and what's to blame?
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train
I'm going off the rails on a crazy train"
114	Chris Cornell	"If you take a life do you know what you'll give?
Odds are, you won't like what it is
When the storm arrives, would you be seen with me?
By the merciless eyes of deceit?
I've seen angels fall from blinding heights
But you yourself are nothing so divine
Just next in line
Arm yourself because no one else here will save you
The odds will betray you
And I will replace you
You can't deny the prize it may never fulfill you
It longs to kill you
Are you willing to die?
The coldest blood runs through my veins
You know my name
If you come inside things will not be the same
When you return to the night
And if you think you've won
You never saw me change
The game that we all been playing
I've seen diamonds cut through harder men
Than you yourself, but if you must pretend
You may meet your end
Arm yourself because no one else here will save you
The odds will betray you
And I will replace you
You can't deny the prize it may never fulfill you
It longs to kill you
Are you willing to die?
The coldest blood runs through my veins
Try to hide your hand
Forget how to feel
(Forget how to feel)
Life is gone with just a spin of the wheel
(Spin of the wheel)
Arm yourself because no one else here will save you
The odds will betray you
And I will replace you
You can't deny the prize it may never fulfill you
It longs to kill you
Are you willing to die?
The coldest blood runs through my veins
You know my name x 7"
115	Eminem	"Yeah! Oh! Get up
Where my dreads at? I said, get up
You know what happens when I'm around, man
Woo! Let's go
Better watch out now
'Cause here we come
And we ain’t stoppin'
Until we see the morning sun
So give us room to do our thing
'Cause we ain’t come to hurt no one
So everybody come and get up on the floor now
And grab someone

Man, first of all, I’m a boss
I just want to get that across
Man, even my dentist hates when I floss
Pull up to the club in a Pinto like it’s a Porsche
Garbage bag for one of the windows
Spray painted doors with the flames on ‘em
Michigan plates and my name's on ‘em
Baby, Shady’s here
Come and get him if you dames want him
But he ain’t stupid
So quit tryna run them games on him
He's immune to Cupid
Why you tryna put your claims on him?
'Cause you won’t do to me what you did to the last man
Now climb in back, try not to kick over the gas can
There’s a half a gallon in it, that could be our last chance
We have of just gettin' home, now can I get that lap dance?
She’s got a tattoo of me right above her ass, man
In the streets of Warren, Michigan
We call ‘em tramp stamps
That means she belongs to me
Time to put the damn clamps down
And show this hussy who’s the man
Now get amped, dance

Now you can do this on your own
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody
Ain't nothin' but a white trash party
So let’s have us a little bash
And if anyone asks, it ain’t no one but us trash
You don’t know, you better ask somebody
'Cause we’re having a white trash party

Pull a fifth of Bacardi from out of my underwear
And walk around the party without a care
Like a body without a head
Looking like a zombie from Night of the Living Dead
And tomorrow I'll probably still be too high to get out of bed
'Til I feel like I been hit with the sharp part of the hammer
Mixing Hennessy and Fanta with Pepto and Mylanta
I shoot the gift like I’m hollering ""Die Santa""
Missed the tree and hit Rudolph and two innocent bystanders
So quit tryna play the wall like you Paul
And get on the floor when the beat drops and stop stalling
They call me the Stephon Marbury of rap, darling
'Cause as soon as they throw on some R. Kelly, I start ballin'
Making it rain for the ladies in the minis
But I’m not throwing ones, fives, tens, or even twenties
I’m throwing quarters, nickels, dimes, pennies up at skinnies
Man, I do this for them bunnies up at Denny’s
From the North, East, and West
But when it comes to them trailers in them South parks
Muffle it, 'cause homie that hood’s tighter than Kenny’s
So ladies, if your belly button’s not an innie, then I’m outtie
Now hop in my minivan, let's get rowdy
Come on

Now you can do this on your own
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody
Ain't nothin' but a white trash party
So let’s have us a little bash
And if anyone asks, it ain’t no one but us trash
You don’t know, you better ask somebody
'Cause we’re having a white trash party

Now whether you’re black, white, or purple
If you’re misunderstood
But you don’t give a fuck
You ain’t doing shit that you should
Long as you know you’re up to evil
And you’re no damn good
Get on the floor, man, and rep your hood

Now honey, don’t let them pricks trip
We should make a quick dip
And go do some doughnuts in the hospital parking lot
'Cause girl, I got a sick whip
Kick the back window outta my Gremlin
Put two milk crates in the trunk
Rip out the stick shift
And make a five-seater
I’ll be damned if I feed a chick
It ain’t like me to split a piece of dry pita
I be the S-L-to-the-I-M to the S-H-A-D-Y
And I don’t need a tank top to be a wife beater
I’ll rip a tree out the ground and flip it upside down
'Fore I turn over a new leaf, clown
I’ll tell you now
I’m so raw, I still need to unthaw
You feel me y'all?
I shut the club down like Drake in the mall
But baby, a body like that’s against the law
You the baddest little chain with the blades I ever saw
Coleslaw containers, empty straw wrappers and all
You got more junk in your trunk than I do in my car
Now get up

Now you can do this on your own
But everyone knows that no one likes to be alone
So get on the floor and grab somebody
Ain't nothin' but a white trash party
So let’s have us a little bash
And if anyone asks, it ain’t no one but us trash
You don’t know, you better ask somebody
'Cause we’re having a white trash party"

Guess who's back, back again
Shady's back, tell a friend
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back, guess who's back
Guess who's back

I've created a monster, ‘cause nobody wants to
See Marshall no more, they want Shady, I'm chopped liver
Well, if you want Shady, this is what I'll give ya
A little bit of weed mixed with some hard liquor
Some vodka that'll jump start my heart quicker
Than a shock when I get shocked at the hospital
By the doctor when I'm not co-operating
When I'm rocking the table while he's operating (heyyy!)
You waited this long, now stop debating
‘Cause I'm back, I'm on the rag and ovulating
I know that you got a job, Ms. Cheney
But your husband's heart problem's complicating
So the FCC won't let me be
Or let me be me, so let me see
They try to shut me down on MTV
But it feels so empty without me
So, come on and dip, bum on your lips
Fuck that! Cum on your lips and some on your tits
And get ready, ‘cause this shit's about to get heavy
I just settled all my lawsuits—fuck you, Debbie!

Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me!
‘Cause we need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me!
‘Cause we need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me

Little hellions, kids feeling rebellious
Embarrassed their parents still listen to Elvis
They start feeling like prisoners helpless
'Til someone comes along on a mission and yells, ""Bitch!""
A visionary, vision is scary
Could start a revolution, polluting the airwaves
A rebel, so just let me revel and bask
In the fact that I got everyone kissing my ass {​​smack}​​
And it's a disaster, such a catastrophe
For you to see so damn much of my ass—you asked for me?
Well, I'm back, na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
Fix your bent antenna, tune it in, and then I'm gonna
Enter in, and up under your skin like a splinter
The center of attention, back for the winter
I'm interesting, the best thing since wrestling
Infesting in your kid's ears and nesting
Testing, attention please
Feel the tension soon as someone mentions me
Here's my ten cents, my two cents is free
A nuisance, who sent? You sent for me?

Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me!
‘Cause we need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me!
‘Cause we need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me

A tisk-it a task-it, I'll go tit for tat with
Anybody who's talking ""this shit, that shit""
Chris Kirkpatrick, you can get your ass kicked
Worse than them little Limp Bizkit bastards
And Moby? You can get stomped by Obie
You 36-year-old baldheaded fag, blow me!
You don't know me, you're too old, let go
It's over, nobody listens to techno
Now let's go, just give me the signal
I'll be there with a whole list full of new insults
I been dope, suspenseful with a pencil
Ever since Prince turned himself into a symbol
But sometimes the shit just seems
Everybody only wants to discuss me
So this must mean I'm disgusting
But it's just me, I'm just obscene
No, I'm not the first king of controversy
I am the worst thing since Elvis Presley
To do black music so selfishly
And use it to get myself wealthy
(Hey!) There's a concept that works
Twenty million other white rappers emerge
But no matter how many fish in the sea
It'll be so empty without me

Now this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me!
‘Cause we need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me
I said this looks like a job for me
So everybody, just follow me!
‘Cause we need a little controversy
‘Cause it feels so empty without me

And the papers want to know whose shirt you wear

This is Major Tom to Ground Control

And I'm floating in a most peculiar way
And the stars look very different today

For here am I sitting in a tin can
Far above the world
Planet Earth is blue
And there's nothing I can do

Though I'm past one hundred thousand miles
I'm feeling very still
And I think my spaceship knows which way to go
Tell my wife I love her very much
She knows
Ground Control to Major Tom
Your circuit's dead, there's something wrong
Can you hear me, Major Tom?
Can you hear me, Major Tom?

And you shook me all night long
Yeah, you shook me all night long

Working double-time on the seduction line

Wanted no applause, just another course
Made a meal outta me, and come back for more
Had to cool me down to take another round
Now, I'm back in the ring to take another swing
That the walls were shaking, the Earth was quaking
My mind was aching, and we were making it

Por los oprimidos, desfavorecidos, a los que se deja morir
Sus barrigas hinchadas, la muerte en sus caras por un interés mercantil
Y ahora tú debes de meditar ¿Quién es el vándalo en realidad?
Terrorismo de estado, opulento y armado, decide quién debe vivir
Vándalo, te hacen llamar vándalo, peligro social, vándalo
Rebelde insurrecto, las cosas no se cambian desde tu sillón
Llegará, llegará, llegará, la balanza se equilibrará
Llegará, llegará, llegará el día de la victoria
Ah, Ah, Ah, el redil es nuestro patíbulo
Alarma, el neoliberalismo es hambruna, muerte y terrorismo
Alarma, el neoliberalismo, prepárate"

Lock up your wife
Lock up your back door
Run for your life

Don't forget your books, you know you've got to learn the golden rule
Teacher tells you stop your playing and get on with your work
And be like Johnnie-Too-Good, don't you know he never shirks
He's coming along

After school is over, you're playing in the park
Don't be out too late, don't let it get too dark
They tell you not to hang around and learn what life's about
And grow up just like them, won't let you work it out
And you're full of doubt


Don't do this
And don't do that
What are they trying to do?
Make a good boy of you
Do they know where it's at?
Don't criticize
They're old and wise
Do as they tell you to
Don't want the devil to
Come put out your eyes

Maybe I'm mistaken expecting you to fight
Or maybe I'm just crazy, I don't know wrong from right
But while I am still living, I've just got this to say
It's always up to you if you want to be that
Want to see that, want to see it that way
You're coming along"

To all the ladies in the place with style and grace
Allow me to lace these lyrical douches in your bushes
Who rock grooves and make moves with all the mamis?
The back of the club, sippin' Moët is where you'll find me
The back of the club, mackin' hoes, my crew's behind me
Mad question askin', blunt passin'
Music blastin', but I just can't quit
Because one of these honeys Biggie got to creep with
Sleep with, keep the ep a secret, why not?
Why blow up my spot cause we both got hot?
Now check it: I got more mack than Craig, and in the bed
Believe me, sweetie, I got enough to feed the needy
No need to be greedy, I got mad friends with Benzes
C-notes by the layers, true fuckin' players
Jump in the Rover and come over
Tell your friends jump in the GS3, I got the chronic by the tree

I love it when you call me big poppa
Throw your hands in the air if you's a true player
I love it when you call me big poppa
To the honies getting money
Playing niggas like dummies
I love it when you call me big poppa
If you got a gun up in your waist
Please don't shoot up the place!
‘Cause I see some ladies tonight
That should be having my baby, baby

Straight up, honey, really I'm askin'
Most of these niggas think they be mackin', but they be actin'
Who they attractin' with that line
""What's your name? What's your sign?""
Soon as he buy that wine, I just creep up from behind
And ask what your interests are, who you be with
Things that make you smile, what numbers to dial
You gon' be here for a while?
I'm gon' go call my crew, you go call your crew
We can rendezvous at the bar around 2
Plans to leave, throw the keys to Lil Cease
Pull the truck up front, and roll up the next blunt
So we can steam on the way to the telly, go fill my belly
A T-bone steak, cheese eggs and Welch's grape
Conversate for a few, ‘cause in a few we gon' do
What we came to do, ain't that right, boo?
Forget the telly, we just go to the crib
And watch a movie in the jacuzzi, smoke L's while you do me

I love it when you call me big poppa
Throw your hands in the air if you's a true player
I love it when you call me big poppa
To the honies getting money
Playing niggas like dummies
I love it when you call me big poppa
If you got a gun up in your waist
Please don't shoot up the place!
‘Cause I see some ladies tonight
That should be having my baby, baby

(How you living, Biggie Smalls?) In mansions and Benzes
Givin' ends to my friends, and it feels stupendous
Tremendous cream: fuck a dollar and a dream
Still tote gats strapped with infrared beams
Choppin' Os, smokin' la in Optimos
Money, hoes and clothes: all a nigga knows
A foolish pleasure? Whatever
I had to find the buried treasure, so grams I had to measure
However, living better now, Coogi sweater now
Drop top BM's, I'm the man, girlfriend

Yeah, honey, check it—
Tell your friends to get with my friends
And we can be friends
Shit, we can do this every weekend, aight?
Is that aight with you?
Yeah… keep bangin'

To make you mine
It is written in the stars above
The gods decree
You'll be right here by my side
Right next to me
You can run but you cannot hide

Don't say you want me
Don't say you need me
Don't say you love me
It's understood
Don't say you're happy
Out there without me
I know you can't be
'Cause it's no good

I'll be fine
I'll be waiting patiently
'Til you see the signs
And come running to my open arms
When will you realize
Do we have to wait 'til our worlds collide
Open up your eyes
You can't turn back the tide


I'm going to take my time
I have all the time in the world
To make you mine

It's beginning to hurt
Time you made up your mind
Just what is it all worth

All my useless advice
All my hanging around
All your cutting down to size
All my bringing you down

Watch the clock on the wall
Feel the slowing of time
Hear a voice in the hall
Echoing in my mind

All your stupid ideals
You've got your head in the clouds
You should see how it feels
With your feet on the ground

Here I stand the accused
With your fist in my face
Feeling tired and bruised
With the bitterest taste"

When you're close to me

So call in the submarines 'round the world we'll go

If you can't get what you want then come with me

Come in black or red
I've seen their worlds
Inside my head
They connect
With the fall of man
They breathe you in
And dive as deep as they can

There's nothing you can do for them
They are the force between
When the sunlight is arising
There's nothing you can say to him
He is without a heart
And the space has been broken

It's Broken
Our love
Broken
It's Broken
Our love
Broken

Is it far away
In the Glitter Freeze
Or in our eyes
Every time they meet
It's by the light
Of the plasma screens
We keep switched on
All through the night while we sleep

There's nothing you can do for them
They are the force between
When the sunlight is arising
There's nothing you can say to her
I am without a heart
And the space has been broken

It's Broken
Our love
Broken
It's Broken
Our love
Broken
It's Broken
Our love
Broken
It's Broken

157	Ed Sheeran	"When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And darling I will be loving you till we're seventy
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
And I'm thinking about how

People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well me, I fall in love with you every single day
I just wanna tell you I am

So honey, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are

When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same
Cause honey your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
And I'm thinking about how

People fall in love in mysterious ways
And maybe it's all part of a plan
Well I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand

So, baby, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are

So baby, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
Oh baby, we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we are"
158	Michael Sembello	"Just a steel town girl on a Saturday night
Lookin' for the fight of her life
In the real time world no one sees her at all
They all say she's crazy
Locking rhythms to the beat of her heart
Changing movement into light
She has danced into the danger zone
When the dancer becomes the dance
It can cut you like a knife
If the gift becomes the fire
On a wire between will and what will be
She's a maniac, maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac on the floor
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
On the ice-blue line of insanity
Is a place most never see
It's a hard-won place of mystery
Touch it but can't hold it
You work all your life for that moment in time
It could come or pass you by
It's a push-shove world but there's always a chance
If the hunger stays the night
There's a cold kinetic heat
Struggling, stretching for the beat
Never stopping with her head against the wind
She's a maniac, maniac, I sure know
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac, I sure know
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
Ooh, oh
Oh
It can cut you like a knife
If the gift becomes the fire
On a wire between will and what will be
She's a maniac, maniac, I sure know (I sure know)
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
She's a maniac, maniac, I sure know
And she's dancing like she's never danced before
Maniac, maniac, I sure know
And she's dancing like she's never danced before"

On a hippie trail, head full of zombie
I met a strange lady, she made me nervous
She took me in and gave me breakfast
And she said

Do you come from a land down under
Where women glow and men plunder
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder
You better run, you better take cover

Buying bread from a man in Brussels
He was six-foot-four and full of muscles
I said, do you speak-a my language
He just smiled and gave me a Vegemite sandwich
And he said

I come from a land down under
Where beer does flow and men chunder
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder
You better run, you better take cover

Lyin' in a den in Bombay
With a slack jaw, and not much to say
I said to the man, are you trying to tempt me
Because I come from the land of plenty
And he said

Do you come from a land down under
Where women glow and men plunder
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder
You better run, you better take cover
Do you come from a land down under
Where women glow and men plunder
Can't you hear, can't you hear the thunder
You better run, you better take cover
Do you come from a land down under

When I need motivation
My one solution is my queen
Cause she' stay strong (yeah yeah)
She is always in my corner
Right there when I want her

But I'm empty when you're gone
And they say
Do you need me
Do you think I'm pretty
Do I make you feel like cheating?
And I'm like no, not really cause
Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her

Ahh, I need her, right here where she need to be
Complimenting my style you're flyer with the Captain of the team
Now move, right, right there, hit reverse girl and back that rear
Roll it with me and then light that up and the rest is history write that, book
My cheerleader, something about her demeanor
Even though I'm off these margaritas can't none of these hoes here come between us
Shorty no regular chick, so I just take her to places she ain't know exist
So she never forget, who the man is
She gives me love and affection
Baby did I mention, you're the only girl for me
No I don't need a next one
Mama loves you too, she thinks I made the right selection
Now all that's left to do
Is just for me to pop the question
Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader
She is always right there when I need her
Oh I think that I found myself a cheerleader

164	Muse	"They'll laugh as they watch us fall
The lucky don't care at all
No chance for fate
It's unnatural selection
I want the truth!

I am hungry for some unrest
I want to push it beyond a peaceful protest
I wanna speak in a language that they'll understand
Dedication, to a new age!
Is this the end of destruction and rampage?
Another chance to erase it then repeat it again

Counter balance this commotion
We're not droplets in the ocean

They'll laugh as they watch us fall
The lucky don't care at all
No chance for fate
It's unnatural selection
I want the truth!

No religion or mind virus
Is there a hope that the facts will ever find us?
Just make sure that you are looking out for number one

I am hungry for some unrest!
Let's push it beyond a peaceful protest
I wanna speak in a language that you will understand

Counter balance this commotion
We're not droplets in the ocean

They'll laugh as they watch us crawl!
The lucky don't share at all
No hope for fate, its a random chance selection
I want the truth!

Try to ride out the storm
Whilst they'll make you believe
That they are the special ones. (we have not been chosen)
Injustice is the norm
You won't be the first and you know you won't be the last

Ocean! Ocean! OCEAN!

I want the truth! I want the truth! I want the truth!"

When the call came down the line
Up to the platform of surrender
I was brought but I was kind
And sometimes I get nervous
When I see an open door
Close your eyes, clear your heart
Cut the cord

Are we human or are we dancer?
My sign is vital, my hands are cold
And I'm on my knees
Looking for the answer
Are we human or are we dancer?

Pay my respects to grace and virtue
Send my condolences to good
Give my regards to soul and romance
They always did the best they could
And so long to devotion
You taught me everything I know
Wave goodbye, wish me well
You've got to let me go

Are we human or are we dancer?
My sign is vital, my hands are cold
And I'm on my knees
Looking for the answer
Are we human or are we dancer?

Will your system be alright
When you dream of home tonight?
There is no message we're receiving
Let me know, is your heart still beating?

Are we human or are we dancer?
My sign is vital, my hands are cold
And I'm on my knees
Looking for the answer
Are we human or are we dancer?

Are we human or are we dancer?
Are we human or are we dancer?"

Just keep your eyes on me
I said, “You're holding back”
She said, “Shut up and dance with me”
This woman is my destiny
She said, “Oooooh, shut up and dance with me”

We were victims of the night
A chemical, physical, kryptonite
Helpless to the bass and fading light
Oh, we were bound to get together
Bound to get together

She took my arm, I don't know how it happened
We took the floor and she said

""Oh, don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me""
I said, “You're holding back”
She said, “Shut up and dance with me”

She said, “Oooooh, shut up and dance with me”

A backless dress and some beat up sneaks
My discotheque Juliet, teenage dream
I felt it in my chest since she looked at me
I knew we were bound to be together
Bound to be together

She took my arm, I don't know how it happened
We took the floor and she said

Oh, don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me
I said, “You're holding back”
She said, “Shut up and dance with me”
This woman is my destiny
She said “Oooooh, shut up and dance with me”
Ohh, c'mon girl

Deep in her eyes, I think I see the future
I realize this is my last chance
She took my arm, I don't know how it happened
We took the floor and she said

""Oh, don't you dare look back
Just keep your eyes on me""
I said, you're holding back
She said, “Shut up and dance with me”

I wish I had a better voice that sang some better words
I wish I found some chords in an order that is new
I wish I didn't have to rhyme every time I sing
I was told, when I get older, all my fears would shrink
But now I'm insecure, and I care what people think

My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

Wish we could turn back time
To the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep but
Now we're stressed out
Wish we could turn back time
To the good old days
When our momma sang us to sleep but
Now we're stressed out
We're stressed out

Sometimes a certain smell will take me back to when I was young
How come I'm never able to identify where it's coming from?
I'd make a candle out of it, if I ever found it
Try to sell it, never sell out of it, I'd probably only sell one
It'd be to my brother, 'cause we have the same nose
Same clothes, home grown, the stone's throw from a creek we used to roam
But it would remind us of when nothing really mattered
Out of student loans and tree house homes, we all would take the latter

My name's Blurryface and I care what you think
My name's Blurryface and I care what you think

173	Eminem	"It's okay, it's okay. I'm gonna make it anyway

Sometimes I just feel like quittin', I still might
Why do I put up this fight? Why do I still write?
Sometimes it's hard enough just dealin' with real life
Sometimes I wanna jump on stage and just kill mics
And show these people what my level of skill's like
But I'm still white, sometimes I just hate life
Somethin' ain't right, hit the brake lights
Case of the stage fright, drawin' a blank like
Da-duh-duh-da-da, it ain't my fault
Great big eyeballs, my insides crawl
And I clam up {​*wham*},​ I just slam shut
I just can't do it, my whole manhood's
Just been stripped, I have just been vicked
So I must then get off the bus, then split
Man, fuck this shit, yo I'm goin' the fuck home
World on my shoulders as I run back to this 8 Mile Road

I'm a man, I'ma make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land
Time to really just take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks, man, I'ma never look back
(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin'
Sorry, Momma, I'm grown, I must travel alone
Ain't gon' follow no footsteps, I'm makin' my own
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road

I'm walkin' these train tracks, tryin' to regain back
The spirit I had 'fore I go back to the same crap
To the same plant, in the same pants
Tryin' to chase rap, gotta move ASAP
And get a new plan, Momma's got a new man
Poor little baby sister, she don't understand
Sits in front of the TV, buries her nose in the pad
And just colors until the crayon gets dull in her hand
While she colors her big brother and mother and dad
Ain't no tellin' what really goes on in her little head
Wish I could be the daddy that neither one of us had
But I keep runnin' from somethin' I never wanted so bad
Sometimes I get upset, ‘cause I ain't blew up yet
It's like I grew up, but I ain't grow me two nuts yet
Don't gotta rep my step, don't got enough pep
The pressure's too much, man, I'm just tryin' to do what's best
And I try, sit alone and I cry
Yo, I won't tell no lie, not a moment goes by
That I don't pray to the sky, please, I'm beggin' you, God
Please don't let me be pigeonholed in no regular job
Yo, I hope you can hear me, homie, wherever you are
Yo, I'm tellin' you, dawg, I'm bailin' this trailer tomorrow
Tell my mother I love her, kiss baby sister goodbye
Say whenever you need me, baby, I'm never too far
But yo, I gotta get out there, the only way I know
And I'ma be back for you the second that I blow
On everything I own, I'll make it on my own
Off to work I go back to this 8 Mile Road

I'm a man, gotta make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land
Time to really just take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks, man, I'ma never look back
(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin'
Sorry, Momma, I'm grown, I must travel alone
Ain't gon' follow no footsteps, I'm makin' my own
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road

You gotta live it to feel it; you didn't, you wouldn't get it
Or see what the big deal is, why it was and it still is
To be walkin' this borderline of Detroit city limits
It's different, it's a certain significance, a certificate
Of authenticity, you'd never even see
But it's everything to me, it's my credibility
You never seen, heard, smelled or met a real MC
Who's incredible upon the same pedestal as me
But yet I'm still unsigned, havin' a rough time
Sit on the porch with all my friends and kick dumb rhymes
Go to work and serve MC's in the lunchline
But when it comes crunch time, where do my punchlines go?
Who must I show to bust my flow?
Where must I go? Who must I know?
Or am I just another crab in the bucket?
‘Cause I ain't havin' no luck with this little rabbit's foot, fuck it
Maybe I need a new outlet, I'm startin' to doubt shit
I'm feelin' a little skeptical who I hang out with
I look like a bum, yo, my clothes ain't about shit
At the Salvation Army tryin' to salvage an outfit
And it's cold, tryna travel this road
Plus I feel like I'm always stuck in this battlin' mode
My defenses are so up, but one thing I don't want
Is pity from no one, this city is no fun
There is no sun, and it's so dark
Sometimes I feel like I'm just bein' pulled apart
From each one of my limbs, by each one of my friends
It's enough to just make me wanna jump out of my skin
Sometimes I feel like a robot, sometimes I just know not
What I'm doin', I just blow, my head is a stove top
I just explode, the kettle gets so hot
Sometimes my mouth just overloads the ass that I don't got
But I've learned, it's time for me to U-turn
Yo, it only takes one time for me to get burned
Ain't no fallin' no next time I meet a new girl
I can no longer play stupid or be immature
I got every ingredient, all I need is the courage
Like I already got the beat, all I need is the words
Got the urge, suddenly it's a surge
Suddenly a new burst of energy has occurred
Time to show these Free World leaders the 3 and a third
I am no longer scared now, I'm free as a bird
Then I turn and cross over the median curb
Hit the 'burbs and all you see is a blur from 8 Mile Road

I'm a man, gotta make a new plan
Time for me to just stand up and travel new land
Time to really just take matters into my own hands
Once I'm over these tracks, man, I'ma never look back
(8 Mile Road) And I'm gone, I know right where I'm goin'
Sorry, Momma, I'm grown, I must travel alone
Ain't gon' follow no footsteps, I'm makin' my own
Only way that I know how to escape from this 8 Mile Road"
174	Michael Jackson	"Oh man! Look at that girl, right there!
Goodness gracious! That girl fine, man!
Look at it, she just too fine! She know she fine too!

She is banging!

She's off the hook!

She looks good, you're right

Hey, I bet you, can't nobody get that girl

Chris, I can get her

You can't get that girl, Mike
I guarantee you can't get that girl!

Watch me get that girl

I bet you never-Neverland, you can't

I can get her

Watch!

I don't think they're ready for this one!

175	Rata Blanca	"(Verse 1)
Siento el calor de toda tu piel
En mi cuerpo otra vez
Estrella fugaz, enciende mi sed
Misteriosa mujer
Con tu amor sensual, cuanto me das
Haz que mi sueño sea una verdad
Dame tu alma hoy, haz el ritual
Llévame al mundo donde pueda soñar
(Chorus)
Uhh..! Debo saber si en verdad
Que en algún lado estas
Voy a buscar una señal, una razón
Uhh..! Debo saber si en verdad
Que en algún lado estas
Solo el amor que tú me das, me ayudará
(Verse 2)
Al amanecer tu imagen se va
Misteriosa mujer
Dejaste en mi lujuria total
Hermosa y sensual
Corazón sin Dios, dame un lugar
En ese mundo tibio, casi irreal
Deberé buscar una señal
En aquel camino por el que vas
(Verse 3)
Tu presencia marco en mi vida el amor... Lo sé!
Es difícil pensar en vivir ya sin vos
Corazón sin Dios, dame un lugar
En ese mundo tibio, casi irreal"
176	Angels & Airwaves	"(If I had my own world)
(I'd build you an empire)

If I had my own world
I'd fill it with wealth and desire
A glorious past to admire
And voices of kids out walking dogs
Birds, planes, cleanest cars

If I had my own world
I'd love it for all that's inside it
There'd be no more wars death or riots
There'd be no more police packed-parking lots
Guns bombs sounding off
x2
If I had my own world
I'd build you an empire
From here to the far lands
To spread love like violence

Let me feel you carry you higher
Watch our words spread hope like fire
Secret crowds rise up and gather
Hear your voices sing back louder

If I had my own world
I'd show you the life that's inside it
The way that it glows when you find it
The way it survives with its families
Friends or its enemies

Let's make this a new world
I swear you can go if you want to
I know that you have that within you
Inventing the first clean and usable
God's greatest miracle

177	Nach	"Letra de Anochece / Manifiesto
Una ciudad que nos atrapa, un amigo que traiciona
Una puerta que se abre, una ventana en la que nadie asoma
Una caricia en la mañana, una pasión
Una rabia como símbolo de acción de una generación
Una luz que ilumina, una canción que me anima
Una lagrima que cae y que limpia una vida herida
Una calle colapsada, un amor que no se acaba
Un político que mira hacia otro lado y no hace nada
Un respeto que se gana, una inocencia que se pierde
Un corazón que se acelera cuando un enemigo vuelve
Un policía que me insulta, un lugar lejos de aquí
Un sentimiento que se oculta por miedo a que dirán de mi
Una familia que se abraza, un hermano de otra raza
Un jefe que sonríe, un consejo que sin más rechazas
Un atajo, un lujo que me distrae
Una calma que me arropa si el sol cae
Un olor que trae recuerdos
Una chica que no sabe que la observo
Un álbum de fotos roto pero que aún conservo
Una libertad que huye, un micro que me comprende
Una venganza justa, un secreto que se vende
Una historia sin comprender, un cuerpo de mujer
Un beso distante, un instante de placer
Un ayer que ya no existe, y un mundo que nos repudia
Un día en suburbia

Y a los que quiero les digo que aguanten, no desfallezcan
Que nuestros días de gloria se acercan
Que solo quien lo merezca será libre
Va por vosotros mis hermanos de otra madre, seremos indestructibles
Escupir vuestra rabia, que no os digan si está bien o mal
Sacar lo que os pudre, gladiadores sin puñal
Por todos los que me sienten y me aceptan como soy
Va por vosotros b-boys

Un tiempo difícil, un silencio que relaja
Un hombre que no se rinde, un simple perro de paja
Una distancia que se asume, un porro que me consume
Una noche, una plaza, una botella que nos une
Una rima que se escapa, un sueño por conseguir
Un horario que encarcela, un nombre que no quiero oír
Una madre que me espera, un acto de bondad, un crimen
Un rap que resucita cuando el resto me deprime
Un te quiero, un hasta luego y un por qué
Una suerte que me ampara porque yo me la busqué
Un billete que sale de mi bolsillo, un vacío
Un barrio que me recuerda donde están los míos
Un pecado sin remordimientos, un juguete que aun divierte
Un solo camino, una vida o una muerte
Un paso firme sobre un charco, un retrato sin un marco
Una página que sigue en blanco
Un canto, un parto, un salto, un llanto
Una gota de sangre secándose en el asfalto
Un árbol que llora hojas secas, una estatua que se pudre
Un cielo que nunca veo porque el humo lo recubre
Un regalo que agradezco, un arte que me hace temblar
Un mar que siempre escucha cuando quiero hablar
Un hogar donde descanso, un lugar de odio y de furia
Un día en suburbia

Y a quienes me escuchen que luchen no todo está perdido
Va por vosotros mis fans os considero amigos
A San Blas y los recuerdos que aún conservo
Alicante y sus calles a las que vuelvo
A mi familia por su amor incondicional desde el inicio
Mi madre y su ternura, mi padre y su sacrificio
A quien ha hecho posible que yo siga aquí
Saltando al vacío en cada disco, esto va por ti

“Solo necesito un día, un día en esta ciudad
Un día para demostrar que estoy aquí, que sigo vivo
Podéis llamarme Nach, el aliado, el enemigo, el loco, el iluminado
Pero yo soy uno más, y solo necesito un papel, un micrófono
Y unas mentes dispuestas a escuchar y a sentir
Solo necesito un día
Un día en suburbia”

Mi padre es el sol, mi madre la luna
Mi hermano es el viento y el planeta tierra mi cuna
Mis únicos hijos son las frases que me invento
Y mi mayor regalo es vivir este momento
En el que siento que callar es un pecado capital
En la capital del pecado me quieren decapitar
Y aunque quisiera criar a mis hijos en un cuento de hadas
Sé que el mundo se acaba y no les quedará nada
Serán ratas y la cloaca les maltratará
La ciudad clavará su aguja y nadie aplacará
El odio que les empuja, no habrá nada, solo brujas
Mientras los niños ricos viajaran en su burbuja
De lujo, de arrogancia infalible
Yo vengo de un lugar donde decían que triunfar era imposible
Nach otro juglar en la jungla jugando a ser libre
Nach otro juglar jugando a juzgar al que juzga impasible
Y esos Mcs tan increíbles cuando escriben
No, no hacen ciencia, no describen lo que viven
Solo calcan actitudes de alguien que quieren ser
Mientras mi mente representa poder como Uri Geller
Capaz de ver el castigo en la traición de un amigo;
Os digo que ahí fuera hijos de puta solo miran su ombligo
Bordes que corren sobre el borde constantemente
Haciendo que engorden sus cuentas corrientes
Poniendo su mueca más seria e indiferente
Al ver que el indigente sangra su miseria en la acera de enfrente
Ya no me asombro de ver a los mismos
Revolviendo escombros, les veo llevar su orgullo a hombros
Luchando contra el sistema que os corrompe
Viendo que idiotas sin nombre solo hablan mierda y se esconden
En la calle donde niños de ojos rojos fuman verde en callejones
Siempre metiéndose en marrones
Su materia gris en blanco un futuro negro augura
Mientras la lluvia púrpura ahoga sus ilusiones
Yo me miré al espejo con los ojos de quien me odia
Y me sentí eufórico, porque todo es psicológico
En este zoológico de buitres y camellos
De perros hambrientos esperando el momento de morder mi cuello
Pero no por ello callo, ni me rayo, ni huyo
El murmullo de un listillo no me destruyó
Solo me instruyo en lo cierto
Como que la ciencia demuestra que Dios ha muerto
Cierto como el fuego abierto en Gaza y Cisjordania
Cierto como ver mi fe moviendo tu montaña, sacándola de España
Aquí es donde está mi reino
Yo también quiero un trono y ¿quién no?
¿Tus hijos no van a clases porque escuchan rap?
No hay por que preocuparse, tus hijos escuchan rap porque tienen clase
Hacen suyo nuestro argot, se burlan de lo snob
No son robots, victimas del complot de la Super Pop
Y toda esa mierda fashion victim
Niñatas que mañana matarán por hacerse un lifting
Esa es la educación que dais, me desespera
Lo plasmo en un papel o me lo tomo con humor como Dave Chappelle
Chapé más de una boca aunque callar también es gratis (eh!)
En la ciudad muchos me ven como a un illuminati
Con otros mi relación es la de un yanki y un iraquí
La vida es así, y yo hasta el fin tranqui
Tú con Trankimacin como boleros de Machín, triste
Tu destino es el que tu elegiste
Y puestos a reflexionar sobre la vida menos mal
Mira: “mira el final es para todos igual”
Es el ciclo vital de un hombre
La muerte como cima y cumbre, y no hay milagros
Siento que el camino es largo
Con el corazón de piedra me visto y salgo
Cabalgo, otro día mas entre guepardos y comadrejas
Y aunque le diga a mi vieja que no hay queja
Yo también quiero un chalet de lujo en La Moraleja
Y conducir un Cadillac, pero soy feliz con ese anorak Panama Jack
Sin más hándicap que subirme a un track y escupir mis realidades
Para ti son debilidades, para mí, sensibilidades
Me llenan, fiel a mi lema:
Ganar dinero del sistema haciendo música contra el sistema
Sin más armas que mis dientes, mi voz es un Kalashnikov
Un cóctel molotov desde el altavoz potente
Con él liquido al ignorante (eh!), lo liquido intelectualmente
La fuerza bruta me repugna, se la dejo al nazi
O al cani que resuelve cualquier pugna de la forma fácil
¿Te queda claro? yo vengo sin un plan
Soy un poeta hecho soldado y solo sé que la mezcla es napalm
Tú sueñas con ser Don Juan, derrochar champagne
Yo prefiero ver a quien no tiene y darle pan, man
Soñador y dramaturgo, zurdo
Prestidigitador del sentido absurdo de la vida
La mía melancólica, dicen que única
Condenado a asumir que soy persona pública
Y mi rúbrica en pedazos
Soy más de abrazos que de autógrafos
Mas de párrafos que de fotógrafos
Y ante los tortazos de la vida, este es mi elixir
Existir es sentir, aquí sentir es escribir
Y sé que el único secreto es que no hay secretos
Solo respeto por el rap antes de usar un chándal Ecko
Yo tengo coleguis que te follan si improvisan
Aunque vistan Levis y camisa
Conocen cada grupo, cada skit
Desde antes del Rap in Madrid
Y tú no sabes ni quién es Madlib
Keep it real es la premisa
Aunque keep it real contigo mismo quizá sea más precisa
Pisa las huellas de este nómada, nada me doma
Si nada perdona el fallo en Babilón marchare a Sayon
Aunque nadie me recuerde
Ni esta ciudad que muerde y devora el verde
Suburbia y sus horizontes, edificios mastodontes
Devoran los prados, los parques, los montes
Y ¿qué nos queda? ¿charcos de asfalto?, ¿infartos?
Demasiado barullo en este trullo
Salto y me escabullo, huyo entre la masa anónima
Esos que se tragan su orgullo pa' después cobrar la nómina
No hay droga más dura para mí que un escenario
Ni hay meteoritos que extingan al dinosaurio
Me refiero al que suscribe, al que escribe
Al que revive cada noche en tu reproductor de audio
Tu ghetto blaster tras tanto mensaje gangster
Tanto lastre, quién se fía, si al rap solo le guía
La fría filosofía de vivir al día
R de revolución, A de actitud P de poesía
Xenofilia, esa es mi ciencia
Significa lo que implica amor por la diferencia
Amor que nos tortura
Porque amar es la mayor locura
A no ser que se ame con locura
Son mis dudas que supuran porque nada dura
Quisiera parar el tiempo como Hiro Nakamura
Pero que mas da mi arruga si mi entrega es ciega
Si el universo es la canica con la que alguien juega
Todo nos llega en su momento y no lo entiendo
Tantos años invirtiendo hasta que sientes que te estás muriendo
Y no, el mañana no es certero, etéreo
Misterio, en serio, sal de tu agujero
Yo tecleo reo en este coliseo de politiqueo
Rappers de tebeo y tiroteos de fogueo
No poseo la verdad aunque la persigo, o eso creo
Lo importante es estar vivo de deseo
Carnal, espiritual, da igual, cada cual en su propio ritual
Medita, para mi es vital echarle dinamita a cada frase
Para dártela, que tu se las regales luego al facha de tu clase
Puede que mi vida nunca os interese
No está dirigida por Martin Scorsese, pero casi
Voy volando entre edificios como un Yamakasi
Así lo hago fácil como Brasil
Y solo ante el papel puedo eliminar tensión
Él me entiende y no me cobra 80 euros por sesión
El mensaje y no la fama es mi bagaje, trepa
Písame cuando subas, te cazare pa' cuando bajes, trepa
Hasta la cima de mis sueños, podrás verlo
Mis sueños son mentiras que algún día dejaran de serlo
Del verbo me llaman vástago, basta con alzar el micro al cielo
Y caen relámpagos en tímpanos
Míranos, somos furia sobre un bumb clap
Hijos de la catástrofe, apóstoles de la verdad
Rap como entretenimiento, que agita el pensamiento
Así alimento a la generación Nintendo
Porque si esta es tu droga, vamos, yo te invito a un gramo
Proclamo el honor de ser furor en tu hipotálamo
Mientras derramo profecías
Mercader de la esperanza y se abalanzan sobre mí como a un mesías
Pero, no hay mejor profesor que el error
Ni mas dulzura que el que sufre y luego cura su dolor
Y así he vivido en estos tiempos líquidos, insípidos
Sin tener miedo del miedo de no rapear lo típico
No es anecdótico, te soy sincero
Hago público un cuaderno con mi infierno interno para conmoveros
Y si este Enero me disloca me relajo y canto
Soma produce rocas, yo después las lanzo
Claro que sí, paso de Hennesey, ron con Seven-Up y brindo
Por el Hip-Hop y el homenaje que aquí rindo
Al lindo frenesí de la escritura
¿Lo captas? almas en miniatura
No son aptas pa' esta asignatura
Y anulan al disparate
Tú no eres MC, maniquí de escaparate, con tu pose de magnate
¿Qué pretendes si así vendes tú ridículo?
Aquí solo el trabajo duro y los testículos dan títulos
Pobre diablo, se cree un Dios entre los dioses
Y tan solo es otro potro en el establo dando coces
Pides a voces gloria y no te la mereces
Yo asumo el drama de mi fama y vivo entre sus estrecheces
No lo planeé, solo volé como Tracy McGrady
Hice del rap mi personal brain training
Ejercicio mental al filo, afilo mi estilo
Compitiendo con la imagen del espejo en el que miro
Cautivo de un tic tac que me atonta
Mi único hábitat un compact
Que te voy a contar chaval
Que por ir de underground no eres más original
Y no por ser de Universal voy a sonar comercial
No tenéis ni puta idea, vuestra verborrea es cínica
Faltándole al respeto a militantes de mi métrica
Aquí y en Latinoamérica, en todo el planeta tierra
Mi rap será, mi rap será la luz tras las tinieblas
Mi rap será la luz (si!) tras las tinieblas

En todo el planeta tierra, donde sea que me escuchen
En España, en Mexico, Perú, Colombia, Portugal, Venezuela
Chile, Argentina, Brasil, Angola, Guinea, da igual donde estéis Bolivia, Puerto Rico, Estados Unidos, El Salvador, Panamá, Costa Rica, Ecuador, todos mis soldados latinos ahí..
Todos, a los que esta mierda engancha
Este es el rap que purifica el alma que la vida os mancha

You must think that I'm a fool
You must think that I'm new to this
But I have seen this all before

I'm never gonna let you close to me
Even though you mean the most to me
'Cause every time I open up, it hurts
So I'm never gonna get too close to you
Even when I mean the most to you
In case you go and leave me in the dirt

But every time you hurt me, the less that I cry
And every time you leave me, the quicker these tears dry
And every time you walk out, the less I love you
Baby, we don't stand a chance, it's sad but it's true

I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)
No way that you'll see me cry
(No way that you'll see me cry)
I'm way too good at goodbyes
(I'm way too good at goodbyes)

I know you're thinkin' I'm heartless
I know you're thinkin' I'm cold
I'm just protectin' my innocence
I'm just protectin' my soul

I'm never gonna let you close to me
Even though you mean the most to me
'Cause every time I open up, it hurts
So I'm never gonna get too close to you

181	Foo Fighters	"All my life I've been searching for something
Something never comes, never leads to nothing
Nothing satisfies but I'm getting close
Closer to the prize at the end of the rope
All night long I dream of the day
When it comes around, then it's taken away
Leaves me with the feeling that I feel the most
The feeling comes to life when I see your ghost

Come down don't you resist
You have such a delicate wrist
And if I give it a twist
Something to hold when I lose my grip
Will I find something in that
So give me just what I need
Another reason to bleed
One by one hidden up my sleeve
One by one hidden up my sleeve

Hey don't let it go to waste
I love it but I hate the taste
Weight keep pinning me down
Hey don't let it go to waste
I love it but I hate the taste
Weight keep pinning me down

Will I find a believer
Another one who believes
Another one to deceive
Over and over down on my knees
If I get any closer
And if you open up wide
And if you let me inside
On and on I've got nothing to hide
On and on I've got nothing to hide

Hey don't let it go to waste
I love it but I hate the taste
Weight keep pinning me down
Hey don't let it go to waste
I love it but I hate the taste
Weight keep pinning me down

All my life I've been searching for something
Something never comes, never leads to nothing
Nothing satisfies but I'm getting close
Closer to the prize at the end of the rope
All night long I dream of the day
When it comes around, then it's taken away
Leaves me with the feeling that I feel the most
The feeling comes to life when I see your ghost
And I'm done, done and I'm on to the next one
And I'm done, done and I'm on to the next one
And I'm done, done and I'm on to the next one
And I'm done, done and I'm on to the next one
And I'm done, done and I'm on to the next one
And I'm done, done and I'm on to the next one
And I'm done, done and I'm on to the next one
And I'm done, done and I'm on to the next one
Done, done, on to the next one
Done I'm done and I'm on to the next one

Hey don't let it go to waste
I love it but I hate the taste

184	Black Sabbath	"Do you hear the thunder, raging in the sky?
Premonition of a shattered world that's gonna die
In the age of reason, how do we survive?
The protocols of evil ravage through so many lives
So many lives (x2)
Mystifying silence, talking peace on Earth
We should just join for ourselves, not what we're worth
Sustainable extinction, a fractured human race
A changing revolution disappears without a trace
Without a trace (x2)
Alright yeah!
Always felt that there'd be trouble
Mass distraction hides the truth
Prozac days and sleepless hours
Seeds of change that don’t bear fruit
Oh yeah!
These times are heavy
And you're all alone
The battle's over, but the war goes on
Politics, religion, love of money too
It's what the world was built for
But not for me and you, oh yeah!"
185	Metallica	"New blood joins this Earth
And quickly he's subdued
Through constant pained disgrace
The young boy learns their rules
With time the child draws in
This whipping boy done wrong
Deprived of all his thoughts
The young man struggles on and on he's known
A vow unto his own
That never from this day
His will they'll take away easy

What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be, never see
Won't see what might have been
What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free, never me
So I dub thee ""Unforgiven""

They dedicate their lives
To running all of his
He tries to please them all
This bitter man he is
Throughout his life the same
He's battled constantly
This fight he cannot win
A tired man they see no longer cares
The old man then prepares
To die regretfully
That old man here is me

What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never be, never see
Won't see what might have been
What I've felt, what I've known
Never shined through in what I've shown
Never free, never me
So I dub thee ""Unforgiven""

A bullet for them, a bullet for you
A bullet for everybody in this room
But I don't seem to see many bullets coming through
See many bullets coming through
Metaphorically I'm the man
But literally I don't know what I'd do
""I'd live for you,"" and that's hard to do
Even harder to say when you know it's not true
Even harder to write when you know that tonight
There were people back home who tried talking to you
But then you ignore them still
All these questions they’re for real
Like who would you live for? Who would you die for?
And would you ever kill?

191	Ice Cube	"Just wakin' up in the morning, gotta thank God
I don't know, but today seems kinda odd
No barking from the dog, no smog
And Momma cooked a breakfast with no hog
I got my grub on, but didn't pig out
Finally got a call from a girl I wanna dig out
Hooked it up for later as I hit the door
Thinkin', ""Will I live another 24?""
I gotta go 'cause I got me a drop-top
And if I hit the switch, I can make the ass drop
Had to stop at a red light
Lookin' in my mirror and not a jacker in sight
And everything is alright
I got a beep from Kim, and she can fuck all night
Called up the homies and I'm askin' y'all
""Which park are y'all playin' basketball?""
Get me on the court and I'm trouble
Last week, fucked around and got a triple double
Freakin' niggas every way, like MJ
I can't believe today was a good day

Drove to the pad and hit the showers
Didn't even get no static from the cowards
‘Cause just yesterday them fools tried to blast me
Saw the police and they rolled right past me
No flexin', didn't even look in a nigga's direction
As I ran the intersection
Went to Short Dog's house, they was watchin' Yo! MTV Raps
What's the haps on the craps?
Shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em up, shake 'em
Roll 'em in a circle of niggas
And watch me break 'em with the 7, 7-11, 7-11
7, even back door Lil Joe
I picked up the cash flow
Then we played bones, and I'm yellin': ""Domino!""
Plus nobody I know got killed in South Central L.A.
Today was a good day

Left my nigga's house paid
Picked up a girl been tryna fuck since the 12th grade
It's ironic, I had the brew, she had the chronic
The Lakers beat the Supersonics
I felt on the big fat fanny
Pulled out the jammy and killed the punani
And my dick runs deep, so deep
So deep put her ass to sleep
Woke her up around one
She didn't hesitate to call Ice Cube the top gun
Drove her to the pad and I'm coastin'
Took another sip of the potion, hit the three-wheel motion
I was glad everything had worked out
Dropped her ass off and then chirped out
Today was like one of those fly dreams
Didn't even see a berry flashin' those high beams
No helicopter lookin' for a murder
Two in the morning, got the Fatburger
Even saw the lights of the Goodyear Blimp
And it read ""Ice Cube's a Pimp""
Drunk as hell, but no throwin' up
Half way home and my pager still blowin' up
Today I didn't even have to use my AK
I gotta say, it was a good day

Hey, wait, wait a minute!
Pooh, stop this shit!
What the fuck am I thinkin' about?"

She's my cherry pie
Cool drink of water such a sweet surprise
Tastes so good makes a grown man cry
Sweet Cherry Pie
Well Swingin' on the front porch
Swingin' on the lawn
Swingin' where we want
Cause there ain't nobody home
Swingin' to the left
And swingin' to the right
If I think about baseball
I'll swing all night yea
Swingin' in the living room
Swingin' in the kitchen
Most folks don't cause
They're too busy bitchin'
Swingin' in there cause
She wanted me to feed her
So I mixed up the batter
And she licked the beater
I scream you scream
We all scream for her
Don't even try cause
You can't ignore her
She's my cherry pie
Cool drink of water
Such a sweet surprise
Tastes so good
Make a grown man cry
Sweet cherry pie oh yea
She's my cherry pie
Put a smile on your face
Ten miles wide
Looks so good
Bring a tear to your eye
Sweet cherry pie
Swingin' to the drums
Swingin' to guitar
Swingin' to the bass
In the back of my car
Ain't got money
Ain't got no gas
But we'll get where we're goin' if we swing real fast
I scream you scream
We all scream for her
Don't even try cause
You can't ignore her
She's my cherry pie
Cool drink of water
Such a sweet surprise
Tastes so good
Make a grown man cry
Sweet cherry pie oh yea
She's my cherry pie
Put a smile on your face
Ten miles wide
Looks so good
Bring a tear to your eye
Sweet cherry pie, yeah, pie
Swing it!
All night long
Swing it!
Like a trained profesional
Swingin the bathroom
Swingin' on the floor
Swingin' so hard
We forgot to lock the door
In walks her daddy
Standin' six foot four
He said you ain't gonna swing
With my daughter no more
She's my cherry pie
Cool drink of water
Such a sweet surprise
Tastes so good
Make a grown man cry
Sweet cherry pie oh yea
She's my cherry pie
Put a smile on your face
Ten miles wide
Looks so good
Bring a tear to your eye
Sweet cherry pie
Sweet cherry pie
Oh yeah baby
Swing it!"
196	Toto	"It's not in the way that you hold me
It's not in the way you say you care
It's not in the way you've been treating my friends
It's not in the way that you stayed till the end
It's not in the way you look or the things that you say that you'll do

Hold the line
Love isn't always on time
Hold the line
Love isn't always on time

It's not in the words that you told me
It's not in the way you say you're mine
It's not in the way that you came back to me
It's not in the way that your love set me free
It's not in the way you look or the things that you say that you'll do

Hold the line
Love isn't always on time
Hold the line
Love isn't always on time
{Instrumental}

It's not in the words that you told me
It's not in the way you say you're mine
It's not in the way that you came back to me
It's not in the way that your love set me free
It's not in the way you look or the things that you say that you'll do

Hold the line
Love isn't always on time
Hold the line
Love isn't always on time
Love isn't always on time
Hold the line
Love isn't always on time
Love isn't always on time
Love isn't always on time
Hold the line
Love isn't always on time
Love isn't always on time
Love isn't always on time
Love isn't always on time

197	Red Hot Chili Peppers	"How long, how long will I slide?
Separate my side
I don’t, I don’t believe it’s bad
Slit my throat, it’s all I ever

I heard your voice through a photograph
I thought it up it brought up the past
Once you know you can never go back
I’ve got to take it on the otherside
Centuries are what it meant to me
A cemetery where I marry the sea
Stranger things could never change my mind
I’ve got to take it on the otherside
Take it on the otherside
Take it on
Take it on

How long, how long will I slide?
Separate my side
I don’t, I don’t believe it’s bad
Slit my throat, it’s all I ever

Pour my life into a paper cup
The ashtray's full and I’m spillin' my guts
She wants to know am I still her slut
I’ve got to take it on the otherside
Scarlet starlet and she’s in my bed
A candidate for my soul mate bled
Push the trigger and pull the thread
I’ve got to take it on the otherside
Take it on the otherside
Take it on
Take it on

How long, how long will I slide?
Separate my side
I don’t, I don’t believe it’s bad
Slit my throat, it’s all I ever

Turn me on take me for a hard ride
Burn me out leave me on the otherside
I yell and tell it that it’s not my friend
I tear it down, I tear it down and then it’s born again

How long, how long will I slide?
Separate my side
I don’t, I don’t believe it’s bad
Slit my throat, it’s all I ever
How long I don’t, I don’t believe it’s sad
Slit my throat, it’s all I ever"

Ooh, I want you so badly, it's my biggest wish

Cool, I spend my time just thinking
Thinking, thinking 'bout you
Every single day, yes, I'm really missing, missing you
And all those things we used to
Used to, used to, used to do
Hey girl, what's up, it used, to used to be just me and you
I spend my time just thinking, thinking, thinking 'bout you
Every single day, yes, I'm really missing, missing you
And all those things we used to
Used to, used to, used to do
Hey girl, what's up yo, what's up, what's up

Can you meet me halfway? Right at the borderline
That's where I'm gonna wait for you
I'll be looking out, night and day
Took my heart to the limit, and this is where I'll stay
I can't go any further than this
I want you so bad, it's my only wish

Girl, I travel 'round the world and even sail the seven seas
Across the universe and go to other galaxies
Just tell me where to go, just tell me where you wanna meet
I navigate myself, myself to take me where you be
Cause girl I want, I, I, I want you right now
I travel uptown, town I travel downtown
Wanna have you around, 'round like every single day
I love you always, ways I'll meet you halfway

Can you meet me halfway? Right at the borderline
That's where I'm gonna wait for you
I'll be looking out, night and day
Took my heart to the limit, and this is where I'll stay
I can't go any further than this
I want you so bad, it's my only wish
I can't go any further than this
I want you so bad, it's my only wish

Let's cross the bridge to the other side
Just you and I (Just you and I)
I will fly, fly the skies
For you and I (For you and I)
I will try, until I die
For you and I (For you and I)
For for for you and I
For for for for you and I
For for you and I (For you and I)

Can you meet me halfway?
Can you meet me halfway?
Can you meet me halfway?
Can you meet me halfway?

Meet me halfway
Right at the borderline
That's where I'm gonna wait for you
I'll be looking out, night and day
Took my heart to the limit, and this is where I'll stay

204	Logic	"Living life like this is so crazy, this world is amazing
One day you're on top and the next she having your baby
Living life like this I get down, uh, when they come around, uh
I do my best to fall back and not, not make a sound
Feel like my mind gone but I'm still here
Don't fuck around cause they kill here
This music, it kill fear
I use it, when I need to hear
Been there, done that
Drop the shit, they gon' run it back
Simple shit, man I'm done with that
Fake rap, take it back
My chain heavy, got a lot of money
My bitch bad, have fun with that
I've been there and don't want it back
If I see the bitch I might run it back

Cause I'm gone, so long, I'm gone, so long
I'm gone, so long, I'm gone, so long, I'm gone
Drink, smoke, vibe, fuck, chill, drive, talk, think about it
Drink, smoke, vibe, fuck, chill, drive, talk, think about it

So what now? (So what now?)
Let's get down—let's get drowned, on this vision
My division is the greatest that's around
Feel the vibe (feel the vibe)
This is where I'mma be for as long as I'm alive
I could vibe with this, fuck around and die for this
But would you ride for this? Better ride, no lie for this
They say ""what's your motivation?""
Cutting these records like back in the basement
Boy fuck a vacation, we do this for love, not no validation

Living like this is so crazy, this world is amazing
One day you're on top and the next she having your baby
Living life like this I get down, uh, when they come around, uh
I do my best to fall back and not, not make a sound

I'm gone, so long, I'm gone, so long
I'm gone, so long, I'm gone, so long, I'm gone
Drink, smoke, vibe, fuck, chill, drive, talk, think about it
Drink, smoke, vibe, fuck, chill, drive, talk, think about it

Wanna get it like this
(I think so) when I'm driving
(I drink slow) when I'm vibing
(You never know, know, know, know) (Lets go!)
I got it, posted up at the crib with something exotic
I don't smoke but she love to smoke
And look good as fuck when she light it
When she ride it, it's crazy, love when I get inside it
Baby stop tryna hide it, if the feeling's there then abide it
Baby girl, where you been? I don't know
I feel like this is the moment, I mean it feel like it don't it?
Shit girl I know that you want it—but fuck all that
Take the time to get down, stop all that running around
I'm feeling you feeling me, know that you into me
Baby girl let me get down, cause my mind gone
That's the type of shit that I'm on
Grip the mic and I go (Whoo!)
Fuck around with this flow (I know)

Living like this is so crazy, this world is amazing
One day you're raw on top and the next she having your baby
Living life like this I get down, uh, when they come around, uh
I do my best to fall back and not, not make a sound

I'm gone, so long, I'm gone, so long
I'm gone, so long, I'm gone, so long, I'm gone
Drink, smoke, vibe, fuck, chill, drive, talk, think about it
Drink, smoke, vibe, fuck, chill, drive, talk, think about it

205	Years & Years	"It's like thunder and lightning
You hurt me without trying
A tempest, you was rising
And no I don't like to be this way
And you're Jekyll and Hydein'
Are you real or are you lying?
So stop with your crying
I can't handle it now

You tell everyone our love went cold
Going round, spreading the word, it's over
If that's how you feel then you should go
Don't come around saying, ""I still want you""

One minute you say we're a team
Then you're telling me you can't breathe
Well you should set me free
Baby, if you're over me
Yesterday you said I'm the one
But now you say you're done
Stop telling me what I need
Baby, if you're over me

There you go, there, I said it
Don't look at me all offended
You played games and it ended
I've got to look out for me
I won't say that it's easy
Oh, I know I hate leaving
But you can't keep deceiving
Does it make you feel good?

You tell everyone our love went cold
Going round, spreading the word, it's over
If that's how you feel then you should go
Don't come around saying, ""I still want you""

One minute you say we're a team
Then you're telling me you can't breathe
Well you should set me free
Baby, if you're over me
Yesterday you said I'm the one
But now you say you're done
Stop telling me what I need
Baby, if you're over me
If you're over me
If you're over me
Stop telling me what I need
Baby, if you're over me

How long can a love remain?
Time never could heal this pain
I thought I believed in fate
Oh, it's so cruel
No, nothing for us would change
Same story, the same mistake
This heart just wants to break

One minute you say we're a team
Then you're telling me you can't breathe
Well you should set me free
Baby, if you're over me
Yesterday you said I'm the one
But now you say you're done
Stop telling me what I need
Baby, if you're over me

Just go if it's over
Just go if it's over
Just go if it's over
Baby, if you're over me
Just go if it's over
Just go if it's over
Just go if it's over
Baby, if you're over me"
